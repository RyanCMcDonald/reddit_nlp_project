camping,"Going to do a two month hang while I build a house. Need plenty of advice!

Sorry in advance for the formatting. I‚Äôm on mobile.

Some details: Construction will start in early July, 4 hours north of Toronto. In the bush, on our lakefront property my dad bought in ‚Äò81. We‚Äôre tearing down the cabin and building a log home for my parents to retire to. We have a shed with running water and a living area, which is where my dad will be staying. I will be storing my clothes and food there as well, so I there‚Äôs no worries about that. My only unknown is how to make hammock camping for two months work... There will be bugs, it will be warm, might rain, not sure yet but I want to be more than prepared for the absolute worst possible conditions. 

Here‚Äôs my gear I‚Äôve collected since last summer:
‚Ä¢ Hammock Gear - Economy Incubator 20¬∞f (more than enough)
‚Ä¢ Kammok - Python 10‚Äô (there‚Äôs plenty of trees, but I‚Äôd rather not use them, details later)
‚Ä¢ ENO - Guardian (I have no worries with this. The area has mosquitos, black flies, horseflies, deer flies.)
‚Ä¢ Sun Year - Rectangular Tarp (doesn‚Äôt seem to have a model number or anything similar. I received it as a gift.)
‚Ä¢ North 49 - Jumbo Parachute Hammock Gathered End
‚Ä¢ Amsteel - I‚Äôve ordered 100‚Äô of 7/64 so I should be fine. 
‚Ä¢ Wool blankets and sleeping bags are also available to me. From my understanding, this should be fine for summertime hangs.

I also ordered a splicing hook set to make continuous loops and probably other cool things I don‚Äôt know about yet, should be here next Friday. I was going to also use the amsteel to replace the stiff webbing straps that came with the hammock.

While I‚Äôm still at home, I want to get to know my gear. Unfortunately, There‚Äôs no where to hang on my property. Conveniently I live across from a forest, but there has unfortunately been an encampment issue there :(. I‚Äôve thought about hanging inside with a stand this spring while I tinker with my suspension at least. I ordered the [AmazonBasics hammock stand](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B076PM29JV?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_image), will be here in a few days.

In July, I want to protect the trees (I‚Äôm the Lorax!), so I‚Äôm not sure what I can do here as I‚Äôve never really done this before... I know it‚Äôs not good to hang on the same spot for more than a few days, but if I want to protect the trees, I just use a stand, right? Is there a way to make straps ‚Äúsafer‚Äù, to allow me to hang via one pair of trees for 2 months without relocating? Would I need/want to somehow protect the rain fly cord from damaging the trees? Or do I just bring the hammock stand and strap poles to the stand and attach my rain fly to that, solving the entire tree damage issue?

Since I have no knowledge or experience, I‚Äôm relying on there‚Äôs advice to be successful here. I have read a good chunk of The Ultimate Hang, Second Edition and have learned quite a bit, but my specific circumstances are not answered by the book. For example, this setup will only exist for two months maximum. The log cabin will have a covered porch which I will use for hanging from then on, so the books suggestions are impractical, in regards to building a pagoda, or a permanent post, etc.

Any advice or tips are greatly appreciated.
I‚Äôm trying to get as much advice on this as possible, so if there are any other forums/message boards you can forward me to, that would be absolutely amazing!","Desperate for hammock camping advice.

camping,"Good morning,

The sun is shining and it looks like camp sites will be open soon. I've been camping quite a few times with my girlfriend over the last few years (she's a seasoned veteran, I'm the newbie) - both in a tent and more recently in her VW Camper van. 

Most of our food is barbequed ontop of coals, which when finished we add logs ontop of and use as a fire to keep warm. 

One thing that kinda annoys me is that we are always using camping gas and a mini stove to brew up tea and coffee, boil water, or heat up anything that isn't BBQ-compatible.

I was thinking this year, to get a camping dutch oven, a tripod, and a kettle that can be used too - and attempt to get it all done with wood fire. 

I have a few questions though, if it's that's OK? 

- As a vegetarian, my girlfriend isn't particularly interested in all the delicious slow cooked smokey meat dishes one could make in a dutch oven, so I think I'm going to be limited to stews, soups, cowboy beans, etc.  ? Does anyone have any suggestions on the KIND of thing I can cook in the dutch oven (as opposed to on a bbq normally) ? 

- Assuming the fire was going the night before, how long will it take to get one going big enough to get a kettle boiling in the morning?",Dutch Oven + Tripod + Kettle - worth it?

We got to camp and set up the hammock spread with our group. The views on this beach are amazing and we were lucky to get out on a weekend where the weather cooperated.The next morning we woke up to a Black Bear admiring out camp. It was really exillerating and could not have gone better. The bear just poked around for a bid and ended up hopping back down to the beach to feed on muscles and anything else it could fine. I always wondered what would happen if one got too close and I'm sitting there in my hammock like a rotisserie piece of meat.

camping,"Looking for some tent suggestions. 
I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and have two pups. I‚Äôm looking for
- plenty of space for my gear
- room for a queen/full size blow up mattress
- head clearance
- ‚Äúoutside‚Äù living space 

Here‚Äôs my two favorite tents:

Coleman Evanston 6
- Pros
‚Äî easy to set up by myself
‚Äî plenty of room inside
‚Äî head clearance
‚Äî lasted forever. 
- Cons
‚Äî the front ‚Äúoutside‚Äù room doesn‚Äôt have window covers. When it rains everything gets wet. It‚Äôs also not big enough to actually be useful, although maybe I‚Äôd feel differently if it stayed dry
‚Äî head clearance works for me but not others would are taller than me

NTK tent. Model discontinued. It‚Äôs like a cross between the Arizona and Indy
- Pros
‚Äî great ‚Äúoutside‚Äù room. Open to the ground. Kind of wish it was a tub floor, but only kind of. Has window coverings that zip tight and it stays dry inside even in heavy rains with the open floor. 
‚Äî massive amount of space
‚Äî stays very dry
‚Äî actually easy to put away
‚Äî great head clearance
-Cons 
‚Äî this thing is massive. It needs 3 people at a minimum to put up and I need a freakin step stool to get it up.
‚Äî very difficult to put up. I‚Äôve put it up a dozen times and it still leaves me frustrated by the time it‚Äôs standing
‚Äî the sleeping area is 1/2 an octagon shape (the outdoor space is the other 1/2) and, while it provides great space, it is awkward space. 
‚Äî the footprint on this thing is beyond obnoxious

I‚Äôve had lots of other tents, but none worth comparing since I‚Äôm looking for something in the middle of these two. I‚Äôd rather not drop $400/$500. I‚Äôd rather stay in the $250 range but I can be flexible.

I would love to go backpacking for a good 6-7 days, preferably in the backcountry. I live in Reno so could drive as far south as Fresno or Yosemite or Sequoia National Forest. I could also drive as far north as the CA/OR border and similar. I doubt much of the Tahoe Rim Trail is accessible or available for anything outside of advanced skills. I consider myself an intermediate winter backpacker.

It‚Äôs my first winter out here, but not my first time winter camping experience. Any suggestions on some place I could drive to, park the truck, and then spend a good 5-6 days backpacking a loop type trail or a out and back trail? I figure, with snow shoes, I can likely cover 8-10 miles a day pretty easy but wouldn‚Äôt want to stretch further than 12 miles in a day due to shortened days. Let‚Äôs keep it it 10 a day to be on the safe side. If the trails are clear, and no shoe shows required (just hiking boots and microspikes or crampons), I could cover 12-15 but don‚Äôt want to stretch it further than that.

So are there any 40-70 mile loop trails in the central to Northern California area for someone who is realistically an intermediate winter backpacker (well past beginner but wouldn‚Äôt consider myself advanced)? Also would much prefer forests to desert.",I‚Äôve got a month PTO (all of March). Where to go?

I've got a 24 foot Aerolite Cub 236 2003 that i want to bring cold weather camping which means i will obviously need the heater. The camper currently only has 1 battery and from what i have read, the one battery will not last the entire night without possibly damaging the battery. If i add a second battery, and i make sure they are charged with the generator prior to night time, should i easily get through the night of running the heater? My generator is kind of loud and i don't want to have to run it all night and irritate everyone else out there camping.

Some additional Details - The camper has two tents for the beds which i know will make it harder to warm, outside temps will be around 30 degrees F. and i was planning on setting the thermostat to 65ish.

I ask this because i do not want to invest in a bigger battery box, bracket, and an extra battery if i will still run the risk of not making an entire night with heat or with damaging the batteries.

camping,,"She Finally Came In! My new Estwing Special 17"" camping hatchet. Pictured with my trusty handmade damascus pocket knife (~discussion of gear choices, elitism, extreme mod pedantry, and determination within~long read)::pen for scale::"
camping,"Well, since I wasn't able to gain the information, comparison, and discussion that I originally sought, I thought I'd post this in a few other subs in an attempt to get advice from people that know what the hell they're talking about when it comes to a chunk of steel.  So let's talk turkey, and if you feel like some morning mod-drama, read further:   

TL:DR:  Cool Axe and a knife, Let's talk about it.  


I'm not going to name name's and call out specific subreddits, so I'll just set the stage like this:  About a year ago, I lost my job due to being at high risk to Covid because of extreme lung conditions and a close-contact family member who literally has no immune system from chemo treatments for lung cancer.  Since I'm almost totally isolated and have huge Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD mental scars from being tortured as a child, I knew going into this, that the only way I was going to keep the demons at bay (and keep myself alive) was to work...  and boy did I work.  

Among many *many* other things, a large facet of my learning experience has been survival and self-sufficiency.  I went about constructing a huge urban garden around my property, learning how to fish with lures, hunt with a slingshot, and craft traps and shelters out of wood found in the forest, using only my trusty pocket knife and an axe.  

So I posted this picture on a subreddit where I thought I'd get the best information surrounding the subjects I've been striving all year to learn.  I even saw a post on the front page of that sub that was almost exactly like my post, although to be fair, I also wanted to talk about the workings of my beloved pocket-knife, so I included that in the picture too...  

#DENIED. 

My post, the message said, did not live up to the stringent measures put in place on that sub to keep out vanity photos better meant for ""Instagrammy type pictures"".  So I messaged back:  Hey, I wanted to talk about gear with the other members, and since there's already a post of the same type on the front page, why not let mine through too?  

I got a reply:  

&gt;A difference is that the other Poster wrote a full comment to accompany the picture post.  Not really sure what the point of the pen and a 'decorative knife' is, so NOT literally the same type. 

Oh ok, no big deal. I plan on commenting too, I replied, as my axe came in with a defect that needed fixing, and I wanted other people to know that too before making a purchase.  The pen is for scale, obviously, and the knife was the tool I've been using all year, it wasn't some mall-ninja 'decorative' knockoff, but a fully functional tool that, as I said before, I wanted to discuss the in's and out's of, for people that might like to get one of their own in the future.  Kind of elitist of him to assume the latter, I thought.  

&gt;Rulers are for scale. Or coins that people are familiar with. Or even jokingly - a banana. Axes are sold by weight and haft length - which you would know having just bought the item.  

So... I... didn't use the method of scale you prefer? But the axe's length is right in the title?  

&gt;The pen is redundant. And pens vary in length - unless somebody recognises that particular one, it doesn't help in an appreciation of scale.  

So... the pen is at the same time a redundancy of the scale stated in the title, but also *not good enough* for people to recognise it's size?  It's a damn Bic pen!  Bic Pens come in *fewer sizes* than coins do... who doesn't know how big a Bic pen is?

&gt;The knife is unrelated to the Comment. Pictures should be used to illustrate your text contribution.  

But... it's right there in the title, d00d...

&gt;If there is a fault with the axe, then your picture needs to clearly show the issue. It doesn't.  

Ok... well the axe just had a bad burr on the edge, so I couldn't exactly show that, but again, I'll happily go over that in the comment section so people know.  

&gt;But this ""burr"" was not mentioned in your title: "" ... Great heft, great split"". Where's the picture of the split? Presumably you will be returning the item to the manufacturer or retailer, though they may ask why you continued to use a defective item.  

I was referring it's 'wood splitting' ability... why would I refer to a defect in the axe as 'Great'?  This is **the third** axe I've received after returning two others for being more 'decorative' than I thought it was, and the other's head bending over like a taco after splitting one piece of wood.  Since it was just a burr anyways, I just shaved it off with my grind stone.  Surely it would be helpful for other people to know this, along with information regarding the shoddy axes they shouldn't waste their money on?  

&gt;The knife was pictured to have conversation about gear in a Post about an ax?  The knife is unrelated to the Comment. As explained before - Pictures should be used to ***illustrate*** your text contribution.  I'm sure the maker intended it to be ""decorative"". It's far from a sharpened prybar lump of steel, isn't it?

It's... in the title... *and* the pict... oh never mind...  but thanks for the elitism *again*.

&gt;There seems to be something of a gap between your expectations of the subreddit, and the reality. Whilst I appreciate the length of time since the reddit account you post from was first registered, you may have missed the development and refinement of this particular subreddit during that time. Perhaps a better match may be found elsewhere on reddit?  

No, dude... I don't think there was any gap in expectations, my post fits the subreddit's intentions perfectly.  I wanted a discussion about wood carving tools, and I got an endless litany of caveats you pulled out of your ass to make yourself the 'debate victor'.  Looks like the *true* intentions of your sub is to pick apart other people's posts **for your own vanity**.  Have fun lording over your precious subreddit...doesn't know how big a Bic pen is?

&gt;The knife is unrelated to the Comment. Pictures should be used to illustrate your text contribution.  

But... it's right there in the title, d00d...

&gt;If there is a fault with the axe, then your picture needs to clearly show the issue. It doesn't.  

Ok... well the axe just had a bad burr on the edge, so I couldn't exactly show that, but again, I'll happily go over that in the comment section so people know.  

&gt;But this ""burr"" was not mentioned in your title: "" ... Great heft, great split"". Where's the picture of the split? Presumably you will be returning the item to the manufacturer or retailer, though they may ask why you continued to use a defective item.  

I was referring it's 'wood splitting' ability... why would I refer to a defect in the axe as 'Great'?  This is **the third** axe I've received after returning two others for being more 'decorative' than I thought it was, and the other's head bending over like a taco after splitting one piece of wood.  Since it was just a burr anyways, I just shaved it off with my grind stone.  Surely it would be helpful for other people to know this, along with information regarding the shoddy axes they shouldn't waste their money on?  

&gt;The knife was pictured to have conversation about gear in a Post about an ax?  The knife is unrelated to the Comment. As explained before - Pictures should be used to ***illustrate*** your text contribution.  I'm sure the maker intended it to be ""decorative"". It's far from a sharpened prybar lump of steel, isn't it?

It's... in the title... *and* the pict... oh never mind...  but thanks for the elitism *again*.

My mom has difficulty walking long distances, past knee surgery, and I've been contemplating on how to take her camping since she has never gone camping/hiking.

I am researching places I can take her which I can drive up to the spot and requires minimal walking on certain parts (e.g. Yellowstone). For the sites that require walking like 2 or 3 miles to get to a spot, are there any recommendations anyone has or has seen that would allow me to get her there?

camping,"Hi,

I picked up the Vango Vista 800 for ¬£20 in a second hand store and I have since pitched and re-waterproofed the tent (everything is fine).

I am interested in extending the tent with a porch/awning but there is no specific model available which is made for it, as the tent was created for Go Outdoors, who did not want an awning designed.

Can anybody recommend a suitable awning for this tent? I have so far looked at the Hi-Gear Universal Porch and the Vango Tigris 800 porch, which both look suitable.

I'm looking to start camping in a month or so and want to have my bases covered with regard to things I'll need. I know that everyone's needs are different, so a few quick things:

\- I just purchased a camping hammock on Amazon, so my tent is taken care of in that regard (though I would gladly accept suggestions on ground tents as well!)

\- I am looking for suggestions on a backpack, boots, sleeping bag, flashlight, lightweight camp chair, food things, etc.). I plan to get into backpacking and traveling fairly frequently, so any and all advance is welcome to a 'newcomer' of sorts like myself.

camping,"For those of you who use blue barrels as a means of storing food in a bear-resistant/scent-resistant container, **where do you purchase the barrels?**  I'm in the market for several of them (either 2 60L barrels, or 4 30L barrels) and the markup appears to be significant. 

There are many people reselling them online; however, I have a few concerns.  First, the resellers are marking up the prices significantly...most are near the price of new containers.  Second, there's really no telling what may have been stored inside them while they were in the possession of the reseller(s).  The market appears to be flooded with blue barrels which were used to store diabetes medicine, which renders the barrels no longer safe for containing food...however, the resellers don't seem to be overly concerned about that.  Isn't the point of these barrels generally to store food? Am I being overly cautious? 

My question, then: where can I go to buy straight-up food grade barrels from a reputable source?

These barrel systems are popular for people doing river trips, and I know a few of you have probably already dealt with these questions. Thanks in advance for any insights you may have!","Finding safe, refurbished/renewed food grade blue barrels"

camping,"I'm interested in camping for free (or cheap as possible) in areas I have not yet explored. Mostly in Utah if that matters. I would like to take advantage of BLM land when beginning my camping trips by car, but it is a bit intimidating driving 2+ hours, not knowing if you can safely and legally camp in a spot identifiable as BLM land from a map.

Basic google research tells me that I can camp anywhere on BLM land with certain restrictions. But I am concerned with the information the blm.gov website doesn't give me. They would have me believe I can camp almost anywhere on BLM land without a permit, but I have heard stories of people getting ticketed for camping on BLM land, or particular areas being unsuitable for camping. I know BLM land is free and I'm not going to be able to just drive in and have a picnic and firepit waiting for me (although for some it does seem that easy), but I can't be the only one to boondock in unfamiliar places on BLM land.

So I guess my question is, how do y'all get peace of mind when picking a spot to camp in the wilderness when far from home? Are there any specific apps or communities or websites you recommend? Are the blm.gov maps up to date? 

Again, I know BLM land isn't going to have the same luxuries of renting a pull-in spot at a KOA, but people seem to have success boondocking and car camping on BLM land. For my specific purposes I would be tent camping within a mile or so from my car (has 4x4), but I use the term car-camping because it's not BLM land I am familiar with, and I have to deal with parking my car somewhere.

So, any help would be appreciated.

About wood:

* Most of the wood will be dry since there is no liquid water in winter so you will have no problem finding some spruce branches for starting the fire.
* Wood is dry, but hard to find... Most of the wood is covered by thick blanket of snow so your main source of wood will be standing/fallen trees
* Thus... 2 hands : 1 axe is a good ratio... thank me later...
* You won't have fire in the night... so deal with it...

Camping:

* Good ground isolation is absolute must!
* Another ones body warm is great but sleeping is worse then...
* Your roof will probably get damp from your breath so keep that in mind...

And also... most of your things that you plan to do won't probably be doable since you will be cold af, we planned on heating some stones to keep us warm during night... But we survived, got ideas for better next time... So hope this helps someone else too ;)

camping,"First post! I have been a long time lurker on this subreddit but have been an avid camper my entire life. I'm in the process of building a Tacoma with roof top tent setup for the spring. 

I had been in the market for a rotomolded cooler for a while. I looked at all the big brands like Yeti and Pelican as well as some options we have readily available here like Woods and ProFrost. I needed a large capacity cooler because at times we will have up to 6 people using it at once. After seeing one in person I ended up going with a Whiterock cooler (TRK78). The build quality matches that of all the top end brands but what really set it apart was it's latch system. It has this 2 stage ""detent"" that not only seems to really set the seal perfectly but also makes opening and closing so much easier. 

I have only done some preliminary tests with it at home but I will eventually be doing some side by side comparisons this spring with some bigger name brands and see how it performs. First impressions though are really solid! 

My truck build starts at the end of February and I am looking forward to sharing more pictures of the build!",Whiterock Coolers

camping,"This winter I started trying my hand at cold weather camping and have been enjoying it so far! however something that has prevented me from extended trips is that I always seem to end up getting my sleeping bag wet overnight. I've been sleeping in a tent (Cabelas Alaskan Guide Model Geodisic 4man for reference) and so far i've always gone with a friend or 2. The tent is big enough for 3 comfortably but inevitably, when sharing the tent I brush up against the edges of the frost covered tent walls. Is there a way to prevent the frost from building up along the walls of the tent? I had read vending is a necessary thing to do and last trip we slept with the window on the door opened. I also (mistakenly) tried a waterproof slip to cover my sleeping bag but I ended up awake at 3AM soaked through (down bag too...). My theory is sweat/respiration from the body got trapped inside the waterproof cover.

I have alternatively been looking at a hand cranked/solar panelled battery pack which has a usb port in it. To have one of the small office/desk heaters. However i don't know how reliable and useful a small heater such as that is.

More often than not we never have an electrical port because we are camping right in the middle of the woods so it needs to be something portable and the like.

camping,"**Cold winds:**

In all my previous camping trips in winter, I must have been lucky to not having much wind, that luck ended the last few days. With day temp being a cozy -10 deg C, and night time towards -19 deg C, sitting by the campfire did not warm my feet. I also could not literally warm my boots too close to the fire, maybe risking the glue and the plastic on my boots coming undone. I realized then that a single layer of wool socks probably wasn't enough. Seems like I would have to consider buying some larger boots that I can use with two pairs of socks + a plastic bag inside.

&amp;#x200B;

**Boots:**

Ugh, I need better/larger boots in winter that is warmer. A single medium thick wool socks isn't warm enough for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drying socks and failing:**

I tired two times to dry my wool socks at the campfire. Once at the side of the flames, and the other time lower at the side of the hot coals. Both times my socks melted and either turned into stiff plastic, or became so brittle, and two socks of different pair ended up with a hole in them. :(

&amp;#x200B;

**De-icing my tent:**

On a positive note, I managed to de-frost my tent after a couple of days out in the cold. I very carefully, used a trangia spirit burner with full fuel, and burned that on the trangia triangle stand, on top of a plastic thingy so it all wouldn't risk melt the bottom or slide around. **I made sure to stand outside the tent during the burning as I had no idea just how dangerous it might be re. toxic carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.** The flame was not hot/high enough to damage the top of the tent. It was surprising to see that the interior temperatur rose to what must have been +10 or warmer, also making sure I have some ventilation going on. I manage to defrost most of the interior in a single burn, with some small stuff left in the corners.

Edit: I should keep better eye on things, because just because I managed to de-ice the tent once, maybe it won't work as well the next time. Only did it once.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spirit burner fuel:**

I made sure to bring an excess amount of spirit burner fuel, and I am happy having done that, never really having to worry too much about running out anytime soon when making food.

&amp;#x200B;

**A relaxing campfire:**

Well, assuming there isn't any wind, it is a good idea to floss/brush teeth and eating food and whatever by the campfire, instead of doing that later in the cold. Melting a little snow on the fire is also fairly trivial, and doesn't have to reach boiling point for brushing one's teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Changing clothes in the cold:**

I like changing first the top side, and then the pants side, while being in my sleeping bag, either in the evening, or early in the morning before I get up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thawing food by the campfire:**

So, thawing food by the campfire was simple enough, I just had to be a little patient. Also, bad idea placing hot dog buns inside my jacket, three of them became squished. :) Also, thawing a small bottle of mustard, I had no patience for that. Placing the small bottle of ketchup some time before eating, made most of the ketchup liquid and usable. To my surprise, the ""beer sticks"" (meat) that I had brought with me, had not frozen, and could be eaten as such without warming them up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Failing to dry my sleeping bag:**

So, after some time out in the freezing cold, I can't help breath onto the top part of the sleeping bag, and that stuff turns to ice. Afaik, that icy part is not a big issue, but still, hanging my sleepin bag to dry outside, there was too much shade and hardly any sun shone onto the sleeping bag, and with the sun being so low this time of the year, I gave up drying to dry the sleeipng bag in the sun, and brought it home instead. :| I have no idea how damp if at all my sleeping bag was, probably not an issue, but then again, I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Added:** I have for the previous two weeks been in and out of the woods, either camping or just being out in the cold, and looking at my toes, two are blue (the ones beside the big toe), and should they fall off, it is an improvement, from when I was camping out in -5 deg C, and lose two big toe nails, and the two beside. I actucally had to yank them off, because they did not want to fall off by themselves. :| My last bad camping trip in 2018, my other shoes became wet and very cold from goofing around in the powdery snow (just wool socks inside autumn boots), and I was unable to start a fire the first day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bacon:**

Frozen. Bacon.  Hard to manage unless you go for thawing the whole package. Probably best to protion at home, before it all gets frozen hard. I sort of managed, and had bacon wrapped hot dogs with sesame seed buns. :) I also brought lompe because there were 8 buns for my 9 hot dogs. I also brought tortillas for my re-hydrated hot meals, but I never used any and took them home. They too ofc were frozen, but with lompe it was rather easy to separate into individual pieces when frozen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Snow brush thingy:**

So, I brought along a snow brush for a car and it worked nicely for cleaning off snow from the oversnowed campsite and also boots and tent.",I learned some new things duing winter camping

Hi! My girlfriend and I are camping down in Turkey and starting 21:00 yesterday, a stray dog has been barking and growling at the entrance of our tent. There seems to be a massive pack patrolling the forest.

We figured it'd just leave eventually, but guess what: it is still here 11 hours later... 

Any advice? Would it be a better idea to just get out of the tent completely so we can scare it off and give fighting it off a better chance (in the case that may be necessary) or should we take a more slow and friendly approach?

I would usually go for a friendly approach, but this dog is clearly very upset with our presence. We're not scared of dogs, but would prefer to keep our limbs intact.

It's called East Rock Springs Campground, in the Sheldon National Antelope Refuge.

It's listed on google maps, there's a couple sparse entries about it if you search for it. There's no campground listed there on the forest service website (though maybe it'd be on another federal website?). There's two reviews on the google listing and they're fairly recent, saying it's an awesome spot, but that's about all there is. It looks like an incredible location. It shows up on google earth satellite and you can see a little path leading to what looks like could be a campground? This is the place on google earth.

I can see the piezo thingy causing sparks, but I have no idea how large the arcing light is supposed to be to ignite the gas.

The gas, obviously comes out of the lighter, and I've even managed to increase the gas flow a little, with no effect.

**Q: What could be wrong?** At this point I am more interested in knowing the issue, than getting the lighter working again.

I did noticed, some time ago, I got the lighter working again, as long as I stored it vertically, but that doesn't work when I try it again. Storing the lighter upright, does not make the lighter light up.

camping,"I think I can conclude that I do not prefer winter camping in -20 deg C. 

I think I would prefer -5 deg C or -10 deg C.

In -14 deg C, I had a fairly good time in my sleeping bag, having a sleeping bag that should be ""usable"" down to -25 deg C. However at -20 deg C I could feel a chill presumably from the zipper line, which was only covered by some thinner bit of fabric and maybe a little filling.

Changing clothing in -20 deg C was surprisingly ok, probably helped by having dry clothing available ofc.

Putting on ""ice cold"" boots in -20 deg C, was also surprisingly trivial, and did not feel freezing cold, because I had dry socks and also had been previously using a shopping bag around each foot out in the cold.

By the campfire I got smoke in my eyes and I got tears in my eyes, and I felt my eyelashes starting to freeze. :D

My campfire lit up with one match though (firestarter heh), as I had been careful using dry wood only. I found some possibly non-dry wood from a fallen tree that blocked a trail and had to be sawed off, so I put two long logs at the bottom of the campfire to better reflect the heat and eventually those too at the bottom started to burn.

I was happy I had been using an assortment of hand liners, gloves and mittens, incl. thin water proof construction worker gloves.

When I got up in the night, feeling the chill in -20 deg C, and I had to take a piss, I had to make a decision if I wanted to try go at it, for the next 6 hours, or just walk home, so I walked home. :)

I had also been using a 1+ liter hot water flask (w. proper screw plug), and I noticed that the bag was still moderately warm after 6 hours being in the sleeping bag, but even with the hot water flask, the chill I felt was not fun and I wasn't sure what was wrong. Could be that it was the zipper area, or, that my neck strap did not fully seal my upper part of the body, even though I tried to make sure I had a tight fit.

I will now probably camp in less freezing conditiosn and also look into what a better sleeping bag might look like.",-20 C camping woes

Noob camper here. I‚Äôm taking my family (wife and 3 young children) camping in a couple weeks at Sam Houston National Forest.

camping," TL/DR: just curious what others do in regards to campsite layout to fend off critters.

I‚Äôve grilled tasty smelling foods on grills and made stews in Dutch ovens for most of my camping life. With that even though food and garbage was stored in the car after dinner my campsites were typically visited by various scavenging omnivores during the night. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was the remnants of cooking grease that attracted them.

They would come check out the tent even though I would wear different clothes than I cooked in. I would hear stuff get knocked over outside the tent, you know typical stuff.

I tried an experiment the last five campouts. I was hiking / dispersed camping. My fire and cook area was at least a hundred feet away from my sleep area. Plus I only made easy meals with a single pot and an alcohol stove. Nothing with a heavy aroma but yet still tasty. I left no food bits behind as is my general practice. My food bag was hung somewhere between the cooking area and my hammock.

The only animals that I encountered were deer. In one case there were a pair of bucks running around a nearby clearing snorting and clicking at each other in the full overhead moonlight.

The other was a deer at dawn who saw my hammock and kept smacking his hoof on the ground while he stared at me. Both truly cool experiences.

Other than that, no trash pandas, bears or anything bothered my campsite at night.

camping,"I just picked up a new 4-season bivy and want to try it out in the snow. The location I was planning on testing it out is a campground in the summer, but in the winter it's mostly unused. It's right beside a fairly busy cross-country skiing trail and a snowshoe trail, about 2-3 hours by snowshoe from a ski resort.

The problem I have is that the new bivy is bright orange and kinda looks like an emergency shelter. I'm worried that someone might see me from one of the trails and think I'm in trouble. Is there a good way to mark the site and make it look like I'm there intentionally? My plan is to dig a trench to sleep in (for the wind) and then mark around it with flagging tape on sticks so I don't get stepped on if it snows. I'll also have my rucksack and snowshoes there outside the bivy which might help.

I still want to be fairly visible so that I can be found easily if something goes wrong and I don't return when I'm supposed to, but I also don't really want to be bothered if everything is fine.

camping,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to order a tent in time for valentine's day, and I've tried looking around the discount websites, and I think I've narrowed my choices down.

Ideally, what I buy will be useful in future genuine camping endeavors.  My girlfriend and I aren't \*hardcore\* outdoorsy people, but we enjoy hiking and I want to introduce her to some good camping experiences in the future.  This tent can serve as (A) bonafide camping gear, or (B) a cheap shelter that we can bring along if we decide to include other people and have (by then) bought a better separate tent for ourselves.

I think [this Stoic Driftwood 3](https://www.steepandcheap.com/stoic-driftwood-3-tent-3-person-3-season) would serve well for (A), while [this Wakeman 6-person](https://www.overstock.com/Sports-Toys/6-Person-Tent-Water-Resistant-Dome-Tent-for-Camping-With-Removable-Rain-Fly-And-Carry-Bag-Blue-By-Wakeman-Outdoors/15439589/product.html?refccid=6JIEM6DEDS6LGGSBC5I54SFTCM&amp;searchidx=39&amp;kwds=camping%20tents&amp;rfmt=top_rated%3ATop%20Rated) seems to fulfill the goals of (B).

For the sake of my uses for V-day, spaciousness, and comfort is more important to me than durability/quality/utility - which is why I'm even considering the Wakeman.  What I'm looking for by way of feedback is whether the I should dismiss the Wakeman entirely because it's crap, or whether I should skip on the Stoic because I'll probably find a good deal on a good quality 2-3 person tent in the future.  I only really see myself pulling the trigger on something like the Stoic (or any comparable alternatives provided below) if it's pointed out that the sale opportunity is really crazy.

camping,"I really wanted to go to this campsite I like being at, but with snow and additional snow fall, I was simply exhausted and failing to complete the last 10% of the trip, and I had to put up my tent near a trail. Pushing on was just not an option.

Worse still, I spent two hours unable to get a campfire started at -14 deg C the next morning. Luckily I could make warm food by boiling water. The sleeping bag was warm, so that was nice, but the nose got cold. I will try bring  a filter mask and cut holes in it, to protect the nose a little while not really blocking air, maybe that will help keep the nose warmer. I even wore a bakalava, but it only has a small piece of fabric covering the nose and the bakalava (face mask) wasn't enough to keep the nose warm.

I did not want to quit, but I can't stay out there atm, so I went home without my gear, but I did take the time to stopming up a path through the snow the final 10% of the way. Luckily I managed to find the unmarked trail spot on, a second time, after the second snow fall, so that was fun. Some snapped branches indicates where the trail goes, but those marker aren't everywhere.

I think I will stay home for a few days and get back out, hopefully after the weather gets a little warmer, in some days it will be -15 outside, and probalby -18 in the forest.

I also had a firebox that I failed to light, so I made sure to bring it home, loosing a kilo of weight from my backpack that way. I also noticed that I had somehow brought ten pegs, probably another 200-300g weight I brought home as well. I don't need the tent pegs in winter.

I will go out again soon and bring more spirit fuel, firestarters and a woolen sweater, lots of matches and most importantly, plenty of plain woolen socks (not the thick one I already sleep with those).

So, btw, I tried out a new thing on this trip. Using leather boots, in addition to adding the goo to try seal the leather from water a couple of days before, I also used to shopping bags in plastic, in my boots. This I think helped me keeping me more warm, preventing sweat to soak the leather boots on the inside. It worked nicely. I also use various soles. Foam soal which is comfy, and soles for better insulation and warmth.","Had to quit sort of, things didn't go as planned (backpacking)"

Good day friends! Thanks in advance for those who take the time to read. :)  

I  have recently decided to bring my dream of camping in my car to life to travel around and have stumbled into the realm of roof top tents. The one I have my  eye on is the  [Tepui Kekenam 3](https://tepui.com/products/thule-tepui-explorer-kukenam-3). It looks like a good choice with the cons being mostly quality of life stuff. My issue is justifying the  price when I could just work on building out a frame for the inside to  sleep on with some storage underneath. However, sleeping inside the car brings about worries of not having enough storage in some situations which makes me lean more towards the roof top.

My question is: What is your experience with your roof top tent?

What is the biggest issue you have had with the tent?

Any recommendations or other options around the same price or lower?

If you could do it again, would you go with a difference setup?

camping,"I went camping this past weekend for the first time after buying some gear from REI. Did it alone and had a good time reading and playing on my Gameboy. The campsite I stayed at was right on the Potomac river separating Maryland and Virginia which was pretty cool. It was the type you park a little ways away and have to carry your stuff to the site.  
  
Was just curious from others with more experience about tricks for dealing with the cold. I got a pretty good sleeping bag that's rated for 18 degrees and a sleeping pad, but could still feel the cold ground underneath (Lows were in the mid 20s) Had on a bunch of layers with wool bottoms and top. I was up for about an hour around 4am feeling pretty chilly even with the bag drawstring closed around my head. I also had an issue where the breath from my nose was condensing on the outside of the sleeping bag and dripping back down onto my neck! Do folks double up and use two sleeping pads in the winter? How does one deal with condensation in the tent? I had the rainfly all the way closed most of the night to try to keep some warmth in and wind out but after noticing the condensation issue I unzipped it a little.  Also getting a sleeping bag back into it's little carrying sack is the most frustrating thing imaginable.
  
Here's a picture of my site and reading by the river! I had a good time and hope to take what I've learned to have an even better time the next trip.  Eventually I'd like to start doing some hiking/camping trips but have to figure out what to do about carrying multiple day's worth of food first. I probably also need one of those camp stove deals but then that's even more stuff to carry. Thanks for reading.

camping,"We have a rather grand tent that we use a double high air mat ress in with an attached vestibule. It's really great, we've been happy with it, but due to some wind damage and what is shaping up to be a permanently bum leg, we're exploring other options. 

We chose such a big tent because my husband is 6'3"" and it's nice he doesn't have to bend over. But really, we only use the tent for sleeping/storing things we dont want condensation to gather on in the early morning. 

Here's our thought process:

Currently we pack up my 98 Camry to the brim. It works, it's just my husband and me. But our trips are usually: find a camp spot, pitch the tent, unload the suitcase/cooler/toiletry bag/camp stove/air mattress/bedding so we don't have a full car while we explore the area/find local firewood and have room to transport it. 

So, we started thinking of a little trailer to put that stuff in that we can just drop off in the morning, do our fun stuff, and then come back to set up. 

Which led to thinkin: my car's not gonna last forever no matter how good a mechanic my husband is. And he's a professional! Coupled with I had an ACL reconstruction a year ago that resulted in nerve damage to my shin; I can't kneel or even have pressure on 75% of my lower leg. So rolling the tent is stupidly funny with me trying to apply pressure with my boobs and elbows. We began to think - we don't use the tent for anything but sleeping. Why couldn't we use a little trailer  that has secured storage as well as a bed? Something that we can leave packed during the week, and just grab the cooler and head out Saturday morning? 

It also appeals to our desire to try a little winter camping. 

We looked at teardrop trailers but they have way more than we need. We don't need a kitchen area, AC, battery bank, shower, or toilet.  

My Camry has a hitch, but my next vehicle will be bigger. Maybe an SUV but I'm leaning towards a small pickup. So I'd have increased towing capacity.

Please donate (all proceeds go directly to the charity) it will really help us to make a difference to the Scottish wilderness. We are planning on doing the trek in April and may even attempt Ben Nevis, if time allows for it. All donations are strictly for helping regenerate the Scottish forests (now only 2% of its original stature) and protect native animals. Thank you very much for your kindness, every donation no matter how small helps loads:))

I chose the charity ""Trees for Life"" as I have always been very concerned about the global impact of climate change and I wanted to help make a difference to this issue in the best way I could. Scottish forests now only span 2% of there original stature and 'Trees for Life' plans on helping to regenerate the Scottish forests and to help conserve and reintroduce native Scottish wildlife. So I decided to get a group of close friends together to trek with me trek across the Scottish highlands, for the conservation of wilderness in the Scottish highlands. Please help me make my dream of global (Scottish in this instance) wildlife conservation a reality!

I'll get right to it. I'm writing about ways to make winter camping fun, whether you're camping in or out of the snow. I don't do much winter camping myself, so I was hoping some of you could tell me about what you do to have fun while winter camping? This applies to car camping and backpacking-type situations.

camping,"So it is winter and with the snow around the more or less easily seen trails in the woods are covered with snow. Wanting to go camping out in the woods I thought I'd check on things to get an idea just how much snow there is. It would be no fun going anywhere with 50 cm snow, or worse.

Turns out there is in my area about 20-40 deep snow.

One task today was to trod a path through the snow to find my way later, and this works nicely as long as there doesn't come much more snow on top of the old.

Another task is actually finding a way through the forest without spending any excess time finding my way.

I managed to find my way, and it was a good thing I had a compass with me, as I knew I shouldn't try move too much to neither west or east. Not only did I manage to hit precisely this one stone on the path that I am used to seeing, I also hit right on the spot where the non marked trail ends on a crossing marked trail, so that was great fun.

Anyway, I spent some 4 hours making my way to my location, where I normally use some 80 minutes.

I spent some 6 hours walking around today and I am exhausted. :)

Because it is winter I had to bring a headlight, just in case it got dark when I was still out in the woods.

Despite me sloshing around in powder snow for hours, my pants nor my boots seems to get wet, probably because I had an insulating layer inside my pants and also venting my pants on the side to have the excess heat escape.",I am glad I checked out my camping spot ahead of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Getting creative**

My family was never one of those families that went on exotic vacations a few times a year. While we couldn‚Äôt afford a spring break in Florida, my parents still found creative ways to take my sister and I traveling when we were little.

As a result, we explored our natural neighborhood in the beautiful state of Wisconsin by way of a few campgrounds every summer.

Years later, I am so grateful for these summer adventures and the lessons my parents taught me along the way. The importance of community and the importance of nature.

&amp;#x200B;

**2020 taught us so many lessons**  
This past year has been hard for everyone and we‚Äôve all spent more time outside in an effort to keep our family and friends healthy. In so many ways, COVID-19 has been and continues to be, an absolute tragedy. There is no way around that. Loved ones dead. Businesses closed. Jobs lost. The list goes on.

Despite these truths, however, I do think we can learn so much from our experiences this year about how to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Visiting every State Park in Indiana brought me more than just the views**  
Due to COVID, I've been able to visit nearly every State Park in Indiana this year. With travel options nearly erased, my friends I discovered camping as the best way to get out during quarantine. These adventures crisscrossing the state in search of a great hike or campsite provided something to look forward to nearly every week. I‚Äôve made amazing memories and gotten to know my adopted home state in more ways than I ever could have imagined.

Each time I visit a new campground, park, or trail, I can feel myself connecting more deeply with my surroundings. With each step on a challenging hike, I feel more alive and the worries of the workplace fade into insignificance. The brain rests while the soul comes alive with the sound of birds, rushing water, and rustling leaves.  


**What I need to be happy.**  
These moments of clarity exploring the outdoors helped me find myself and what I believe matters. What I need to be happy.  


**It comes down to two rules:**  


Love the people you are with and love yourself.  


If you find the right crew, keep them around.

If you find something you love, keep doing it.  


Everything else will fall into place. For me, by connecting with the outdoors and sharing my love for nature with like-minded individuals, I found what I needed to feel joy in a horrifying year. For you it could be anything.",My friend's awesome story about how camping brought his family together and helped him define happiness for himself in 2020.

I‚Äôm a college student in Upstate New York and I currently assist the Lake Placid New York Development Committee to help plan projects in tandem with Clarkson University that seek to improve both the community feel, public economy, and tourist attraction of the town and the surrounding park. I‚Äôd love to hear from all of you about your trips to the park in the past, what you did, what you loved about it, what you hated. It doesn‚Äôt have to be just about Lake Placid, but those stories are welcome too! I‚Äôve lived near the park my whole life and have worked pretty closely with some of its local officials. Hearing stories from people who love the land and experiencing the natural beauty of the Adirondacks has always been an incredible way to learn about what matters to people the most. Stories. Photos. They‚Äôre so much better than just trying to ask someone what‚Äôs good or bad!

camping,"I was booking camping reservations last night for this summer and found out the US National Park system is extending free entrance fee into National Parks for 5th graders and their families. This is usually only for 4th graders. The park service extended it to 5th graders because many parks were closed last year because of Covid. Fifth graders do need to complete a brief (easy) test and print out the entry pass but then they and whomever else is in their car get into National Parks for free. Details in link. Rocky Mountain NP, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and all others are included. Daily fees are usually $25-$35 per car per day. This pass makes it free until mid August.

Our combined weight is approximately 500lbs- he‚Äôs muscular, and I‚Äôm just super tall and chunky lmao.

I was camping in the Appalachian Mountains in Eastern Tennessee near a river. Around 130 in the morning I was awoken for some reason. I heard the river rumble past but I also heard what sounded like splashing and ‚Äúlaughing.‚Äù The splashing sounded as if it was a kayak paddle pushing the water but it had no real rhythm to it. And when I say laughing, it was almost as if I was hearing a family kayaking down the river and giggling at jokes and such. I summed it up to being crazy people kayaking in the middle of the night. I listened for around 30 minutes before O drifted back off to sleep. It never seem to fade or grow silent it was pretty consistent.

 1. A good drying place  
Under the [awning](https://www.chinafoldingtent.com) is the best place to dry your clothes. The awning can block the wind and rain, and the lower part can be equipped with a drying rack to dry the clothes, even if it rains suddenly when you are out. More importantly, it can cut off the damage of ultraviolet rays to clothing and prevent clothing from fading and becoming old.

2. Harmony and unity of shading and daylighting  
While shielding the scorching summer, it can reflect strong sunlight into the room in the form of diffused light, so that the indoor light is bright and not dazzling, and does not affect the view from the window outside the room, extending people's living space from the interior Going outdoors creates a new living space.

3. Anti-ultraviolet function  
The sunshade's sunshade cloth has a special anti-ultraviolet function, which not only protects human skin from ultraviolet rays but also greatly extends the service life of indoor decoration and furniture.

There are a variety of patterns and colors of covering cloth. Users can personalize and decorate the window surroundings according to their own tastes. They can also choose the appropriate awning model according to the shape of the building to make the building equipped with the awning of the day The objects are more personalized decoration, thereby enhancing the image of the overall building.",What Is The Role And Function Of The Awning?

„ÄÄ„ÄÄDo it yourself, how to, outdoor life

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe investment [pavilion](https://www.chinafoldingtent.com/) seems a bit expensive, you can only use it in summer and the rest of the year, it sits there, no one uses it. This seems to be a waste of money, but you can never go wrong again. The pavilion can be used all year round, but you must know how to use the pavilion and for what purpose. So go out there, buy a pavilion, and use it all the time in some of the most unusual but awesome ways.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 1-Turn it into an outdoor cinema

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSince the pavilion is already set up, you can easily convert it into a home theater. Drag the TV, CD system, and other speakers to the pavilion for installation, or just buy another set of entertainment equipment (flat screen, soundbar), which can be covered and sealed when not in use.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter the theater opens, organize a party with your friends and family, watch the latest 3D movies, host a sports night, and even watch your favorite shows in this exotic new entertainment venue you created for yourself and your family. Unfavorable weather such as rain or strong wind may prevent you from using the pavilion, but you can invest in heavy-duty PVC solid walls to keep the pavilion warm and safe. Alternatively, you can use the pavilion when the weather is not too severe. Mother Nature does not show her anger every winter night or weekend.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 2-Temporary Shelter

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you have a movable pavilion, you can easily move the pavilion in the hot summer to provide temporary shelter for vehicles. Install a pavilion on the driveway or sidewalk, and then park the car in the shade.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 3-Build a greenhouse

„ÄÄ„ÄÄBuild a small garden in the pavilion to protect the environment. In winter, establish a small garden and plant seasonal vegetables such as potatoes, onions, peppers, eggplants, etc. Don't forget to buy strong or flexible plastic walls to keep the inside of the pavilion warm and moist. With the right heater, you can easily get a comfortable supply of fresh vegetables throughout the winter.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 4-Open a pop-up store

„ÄÄ„ÄÄDo you have a small business? Use it as a pop-up store by setting up temporary pavilions in parking lots, exhibitions, and popular shopping areas. You may need a license or permit, but this is a significant way to increase awareness of local businesses with minimal investment.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 5-Charity Activities

„ÄÄ„ÄÄCharity activities are an excellent way to collect food, money, and clothes for the poor. If you have a portable pavilion, place it near a church, hospital, or any event to promote charitable activities. With the right pavilion, you can attract walkers into the pavilion and encourage them to follow your favorite charity. After all, any kind of contribution can have a huge impact on any non-profit organization.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 6-Temporary storage

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAre you decorating the house? Or do you have to leave your home for a few days because of pests and fog? Use the pavilion as a temporary shelter or a place to temporarily store your property. In summer, this is possible. However, in rainy weather and winter, you may need extra protection. Under these adverse conditions, make sure you have a strong PVC wall to provide temperature control and protect you and your property from strong winds.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 7-Use it as a team-building exercise

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFor seminar organizers, teamwork is a great way to encourage a community atmosphere. Building things together is a great way to encourage team unity, and the pavilion is a perfect choice. In a company seminar, you can divide your colleagues into teams and then compete. The team that built the pavilion received the reward first. This team exercise can encourage unity and ensure mutual communication and better professional ethics between teams. Of course, you can also set the pavilion as an outdoor seating area during business seminars, or set the pavilion as an outdoor snack area during business lunches or events.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 8 ‚Äì Make jazz on the kid‚Äôs birthday party

„ÄÄ„ÄÄChildren like to have fun birthday parties. If you already have a temporary gazebo, hold a pantomime, puppet show, or magic show in the gazebo and make the kids happy throughout the party. You can rent two more pavilions, and hire temporary tattooists, handicraft teachers, etc. Your young guests will have a wonderful time.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 9-Giveaway

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you have a company, the pavilion is a great way to promote your company locally. Created pavilions with logos and distributed them to your vendors as freebies. You can also give it away to customers who shop in your store or customers who win simple daily contests.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 10-beach party

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you organize a beach party, then you know it can be very windy and cold at night. In order to provide temporary protection, please set up a pavilion on the beach and place lounges, rocking chairs, and carpets in the pavilion to relax.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAs you can see, the pavilion is the perfect holiday destination when it comes to relaxing outdoors. Just sitting in the pavilion completely comfortably in the pavilion can provide a multi-purpose investment.",10 Unusual But Great Ways To Use The Gazebo

camping,"I recently bought a truck and I‚Äôm trying to decide how I want to focus my camping set up. 

I have thought about buying a camper shell, building a bed frame with storage and sleeping in the truck bed. Only one issue, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 and have a measly 5 and a half foot bed. I could sleep diagonally but this would make it very difficult if another person were joining me.

I am also very interested in doing the roof top tent option which would be mounted on a truck bed rack. I love the idea of this because I could then use my truck bed for other items and likely be more comfortable. I would also be able to more comfortably fit another person. My main concern with this option is the durability and the longevity of these roof top tents compared to a camper shell where I wouldn‚Äôt have this concern.

camping,"Another Redditor just posted their pics of backcountry camping in Algonquin Park, and I have a flood of good memories from about 20 years ago in the late 2000's when a handful of buds and I used to go winter camping between Chirstmas and New years each year. I thought I'd share, even though this reddit seems more dedicated to pics than words :)

We never took tents. Back then, hot camping wasn't a thing, and we felt like we could get by without one - but that didn't preclude us taking some other ""creative"" shelters. We weren't much good at lightweight camping. I recall my pack was over 80lbs every time we went. Our clothes were mostly wool and we didn't do ""high tech"" fabrics since we were all broke, and the army surplus store was down the road.  Sleds were a prominent part of our gear.

In year 1 - we thought this was a once in a lifetime adventure, so everyone over planned and overpacked with all sorts of expectations and concerns. We arrived at Algonquin Park at the crack of dawn and hiked back into the woods on the Western Uplands trail (IIRC). Pulling the sleds and hiking in the snow was far harder than we'd anticipated. We moved slower than we thought we would and quickly saw we wouldn't be reaching our intended goal. Eventually we reached Starling Lake and declared it ""home"". 

John pulled out a huge 50'X25' Canadian Tire tarp and we started to talk about how we'd set it up to make a shelter. Eventually we stretched out the tarp on the snow and decided that we'd dig a pit to stretch the tarp over. The pit was dug, and  the tarp stretched out. by time we were done digging, the sun was getting low. It was a warm night for January though. No one was cold, and the snow was getting heavy - there may have even been a light fog. We found some dead trees in the woods and stripped their branches for firewood. The spars that were left, we laid across the pit to hold up the tarp, and lashed a grid together, then stretched the tarp over the trees and crawled inside dragging in our gear behind us. 

As we got the fire going to cook dinner, John produced a large piece of Tyvek housewrap.  We set 4 spars in the ground and made a gazebo as a light drizzle began to fall. As we ate, the drizzle thickened and we became concerned about freezing rain. After a meal of reconstituted dehydrated whatever it was, we all made a run for our shelter to stay dry, and indeed, it was very cosy inside - but the roof didn't have much insulation. We all decided that a quick shoveling session to put snow on the tarp roof would be a good idea. an hour later, the roof had a consistent 6"" layer of snow on it, and everyone headed back inside to dry out.

With about a half-dozen candle-lanterns lighting the space, everyone settled into or onto their sleeping arrangements. With the weight of the snow, the roof was a few inches lower. In the spaces between the spars, the tarp sagged more, but it was all good and warm and comfortable.

It wasn't until after we were asleep that the drizzle became rain. The rain was gentle and silent and we didn't hear it hitting the tarp since the snow muffled the sound. I think it was Jim who woke first. His sleeping bag had soaked through, and he woke up everyone else. The weight of the rain on the tarp had made it sag down to where it was nearly touching me, and the water in the snow pit was coming up from below. I was on a cot about 4"" off the ground and about 1"" from the ceiling and trapped between the water above and the water below. No one was getting out of the snow pit dry, and all of our gear was soaked through.

We all scrambled to the gazebo, which had collapsed with the weight of water. For the rest of the night we would stand outside alternating between trying to rescue our fire (which sank into the ground as it burned) and the gazebo (that kept wanting to tip over with the weight of water it was holding). 

As the night went on, nature was kind to us, and the temperatures dropped below freezing, turning the freezing rain to snow and the water to ice. Eventually, 2 of the guys were able to return to bed, but John and I stayed up tending the fire and the gazebo. 

As soon as the sun reappeared, we got everyone up and assessed how bad things were. I recall my backpack being a frozen brick. That may be incorrect, but for sure it was not in good shape. we decided to dismantle camp and hike back out. Everything weighed extra with all the water. Dis assembling the pit was a mammoth chore with the tarp frozen to the poles. 

Luckily we had food for 4 days and had only stayed 1. We ate well and laughed about our mistakes as we tore camp down. everyone was exhausted. On the way out, the trails were a skiff of snow over a slick of ice, and we all had to lean on each other as we trudged along with packs that were all over 100 lbs.

That year set the tone for all the years of winter camping that followed. It was the first great failed experiment - others would follow including home-made snowshoes falling apart on the trail, a mitten dryer that turned into a blowtorch when put over the fire, The year we arrived too late to build quinzees and ended up sleeping out in the open, the year we took a marine from Florida with us who had never seen snow, and so on. While all of our trips had amazing failures, we never felt like we were in real danger, and always came away laughing and having a great story to share. 

Jim and John are in their late 60's now and no longer camping. I miss going out there with them. I'd do it again in heartbeat.",Winter camping memories

camping,I got the Nomad around three weeks ago and since then I have used it on two camping trips. I want to give you a no bs review so I‚Äôll just list my personal pros and cons about the tool.

The versatility of this thing is great it has like 13 or so tools (of which I probably use 6) but just cutting down Six tools into one makes the purchase great for me. Now the cons: the weight is more then I thought it would be (this might not necessarily be a bad thing but I just was caught off guard by it) and the knife on the tool is dull so I had to sharpen it on my stone.

camping,"I decided one day that I was going to stop buying duraflame logs since they are a waste of money. Duraflame logs are made of three ingredients. Wax sawdust and seeds (for crackling sounds). 

Apparently a lot of people have sources for free sawdust near them but I can‚Äôt seem to find any of that so I came up with my own recipe. Instead of sawdust I substitute charcoal.


Here is the recipe

Take lump charcoal (home made or store bought) and grind it into a sand like powder using a blender/ food processor.
[tip: use a wire spoon called a spider to pick the coals out of a cold fire, shake off the soot and salvage the charcoal]

Melt wax in an all metal pot or kettle [this is importand] and pour it into a container with the charcoal until it becomes like wet sand when you mix it.

Scoop out the mixture with you hands when it cools down *JUST* enough and scoop it into a sheet of aluminum foil. Wrap the aluminum foil around the pile of charcoal and once fully enclosed, massage into the shape of a loaf/log. Set aside till completely room temp (about an hour for me)

Unwrap loaf from foil and place onto wax paper, wrap wax paper around about 3 times and press sides like a burrito so it is fully enclosed in wax paper.

***here is why it‚Äôs important to use a fully metal pot to melt the wax*** 

You can place the used pot on its side in a fire to burn off the wax and leave behind just soot, that can be easily scrubbed off with Brillo or steel wool with some washing abrasive if needed until all the black is gone.


Now some people don‚Äôt like using paraphin wax becouse some studies show it produces certain unhealthy chemicals when burned. I don‚Äôt have a problem with paraphin wax but if you do then you can use bees wax or if that‚Äôs too expensive use vegetable waxes like soy wax.",I think I figured out the perfect campfire fuel recipe.

camping,"So, it was late in November month I think, it was about 0 deg Celcius and there were strong winds. It was so shocking to me how cold it was, and my wool cap nearly flew off in the winds, partly because of how my old woolen cap had loosened over the years, no longer sitting tightly around my head.

So.. I ordered this new headwear with fake fur around the top and basically around the face. :) It should be a lot warmer than my old woolen cap, especially around the ears.

Next up, I should probably buy some mittens, because I have no warm gloves that are decent below 0 deg C. :( One can buy wool liners, but ofc, those has to fit inside your gloves or whatever. Too bad my old wool liners for hands has started to come undone in the seams on the fingers, have to consider buying some new stuff.","I had to buy new headwear, I hadn't realized the stuff I had was not good enough."

camping,"I am looking to buy some land near a national park to rent out to people who have RVs. I am someone who has never ever camped, and has always stayed in hotels when visiting these parks. I want to invest in the bare minimum at this point in time, and then eventually build a house to rent it out on AirBnB. For now, I was thinking of renting the land through Hipcamp and making it clear that there are no toilet facilities available, that the RV would need to come equipped with toilets, and that no dumping is allowed. Apart from the land being close to the national park, there would literally be no other amenities offered. Is there anyone in the RV community that would even go for something like this?

And stacking the floor and floorprint doesn't help and maybe makes it worse by trapping water between them. I've read online that to be sure that your tent floor is waterproof you need a 1500mm waterproof rating. Can anybody tell me if this is true or give me personal experiences with big agnes tents.

camping,"Hi guys. 
So for a while now I‚Äôve had an intense feeling of wanting to run away from what I have now and who I have now and go totally alone with the only worry being food, shelter and safety. I live in the UK, so the only ‚Äúbigger‚Äù forests are in the highlands of Scotland. Scotland also being the only place in the UK where free camping is legal; is why that would be the best destination. Temperatures can and have got to -10 degree Celsius/ 14 Fahrenheit in the winter with snow getting up to 6-14inches in the area I‚Äôm looking at. Weather is typically cold for around 3 months.Unlike Chris I want to be totally prepared with stuff that will keep me alive, especially during winter. And I‚Äôm also thinking long term so how would I keep replacing what I have if they became damaged etc etc. So many things popping up in my head which is probably telling me not to, but it‚Äôs making me so so happy and purposeful thinking about it. Shelter, warmth water I think would be the main important thing,  then obviously food. We don‚Äôt have the diversity of animals the US does so that‚Äôs a small worry of mine, although we also don‚Äôt have many predatory animals to worry about. I‚Äôve thought about building a shelter into a save kinda thing like you see on the primitive videos on YouTube, except mine won‚Äôt be fancy water falls lol. Also building a fire place with a working fire/chimney . I don‚Äôt have hunting skills, actually none at all so advise there will be good especially traps as that‚Äôs taken my interest. Idk what I‚Äôm asking really I‚Äôm just asking for any advise you guys can throw at me, few things I‚Äôve mentioned as you‚Äôve read if you could help with those.

My dates are June 18th to July 9th and can post a more detailed itinerary if needed. I know this sub is for camping in general but if anyone has an idea of a better one for these questions please let me know. 

1. My first stop is Grand Teton NP, I'm leaving from Northern Colorado and expecting to get to Grand Teton around 2 or 3pm- is all hope lost at trying to find a FF campsite? Some of the stuff I've read says that Gros Venture and Lizard Creek would be my best bet but I'm worried I won't get a spot. 
2. I have about 1 and 1/2 days in Yellowstone (I know it's not nearly enough time), but what are the realistic ""must see's"" in that timeframe? I'm staying in the Madison Campground if that helps.
3. I'll arrive in Glacier on 6/23 and am worried that going to the sun road won't be open. Any suggestions on other areas to see/explore if this road isn't open? I also haven't made reservations here but am leaning towards Many Glaciers or St. Marys campgrounds- any input on those?
4. After I hit North Cascades and Mt. Rainier I'm heading to Olympic and realized that I am not going to have nearly enough time to even see the highlights. My current plan is to stay at the Kalaloch Campground and try to see the HOH rainforest and some of the beaches. Is there anything else I should try to see on the south side? Or a better way to spend my 1 1/2 days? 
5. I will be in Salem Oregon for the 4th of July as an in between- is there anything special I should see while there? I'm just staying the night so I won't have a ton of time there! 

I know that I'm trying to pack a lot into a short amount of time but I'm really hoping to see as much as possible. The parks I'm visiting are as follows: Grand Teton, Yellowstone, Glacier, North Cascades, Mt. Rainier, Olympic, Crater Lake. I only have 1-2 days in each park, but if anyone has any input about any of them I would love to hear it! Thanks!",Looking for input on NPS Road Trip

camping,"Going to do a two month hang while I build a house. Need plenty of advice!

Sorry in advance for the formatting. I‚Äôm on mobile.

Some details: Construction will start in early July, 4 hours north of Toronto. In the bush, on our lakefront property my dad bought in ‚Äò81. We‚Äôre tearing down the cabin and building a log home for my parents to retire to. We have a shed with running water and a living area, which is where my dad will be staying. I will be storing my clothes and food there as well, so I there‚Äôs no worries about that. My only unknown is how to make hammock camping for two months work... There will be bugs, it will be warm, might rain, not sure yet but I want to be more than prepared for the absolute worst possible conditions. 

Here‚Äôs my gear I‚Äôve collected since last summer:
‚Ä¢ Hammock Gear - Economy Incubator 20¬∞f (more than enough)
‚Ä¢ Kammok - Python 10‚Äô (there‚Äôs plenty of trees, but I‚Äôd rather not use them, details later)
‚Ä¢ ENO - Guardian (I have no worries with this. The area has mosquitos, black flies, horseflies, deer flies.)
‚Ä¢ Sun Year - Rectangular Tarp (doesn‚Äôt seem to have a model number or anything similar. I received it as a gift.)
‚Ä¢ North 49 - Jumbo Parachute Hammock Gathered End
‚Ä¢ Amsteel - I‚Äôve ordered 100‚Äô of 7/64 so I should be fine. 
‚Ä¢ Wool blankets and sleeping bags are also available to me. From my understanding, this should be fine for summertime hangs.

I also ordered a splicing hook set to make continuous loops and probably other cool things I don‚Äôt know about yet, should be here next Friday. I was going to also use the amsteel to replace the stiff webbing straps that came with the hammock.

While I‚Äôm still at home, I want to get to know my gear. Unfortunately, There‚Äôs no where to hang on my property. Conveniently I live across from a forest, but there has unfortunately been an encampment issue there :(. I‚Äôve thought about hanging inside with a stand this spring while I tinker with my suspension at least. I ordered the [AmazonBasics hammock stand](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B076PM29JV?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_image), will be here in a few days.

In July, I want to protect the trees (I‚Äôm the Lorax!), so I‚Äôm not sure what I can do here as I‚Äôve never really done this before... I know it‚Äôs not good to hang on the same spot for more than a few days, but if I want to protect the trees, I just use a stand, right? Is there a way to make straps ‚Äúsafer‚Äù, to allow me to hang via one pair of trees for 2 months without relocating? Would I need/want to somehow protect the rain fly cord from damaging the trees? Or do I just bring the hammock stand and strap poles to the stand and attach my rain fly to that, solving the entire tree damage issue?

Since I have no knowledge or experience, I‚Äôm relying on there‚Äôs advice to be successful here. I have read a good chunk of The Ultimate Hang, Second Edition and have learned quite a bit, but my specific circumstances are not answered by the book. For example, this setup will only exist for two months maximum. The log cabin will have a covered porch which I will use for hanging from then on, so the books suggestions are impractical, in regards to building a pagoda, or a permanent post, etc.

Any advice or tips are greatly appreciated.
I‚Äôm trying to get as much advice on this as possible, so if there are any other forums/message boards you can forward me to, that would be absolutely amazing!","Desperate for hammock camping advice.

camping,"Good morning,

The sun is shining and it looks like camp sites will be open soon. I've been camping quite a few times with my girlfriend over the last few years (she's a seasoned veteran, I'm the newbie) - both in a tent and more recently in her VW Camper van. 

Most of our food is barbequed ontop of coals, which when finished we add logs ontop of and use as a fire to keep warm. 

One thing that kinda annoys me is that we are always using camping gas and a mini stove to brew up tea and coffee, boil water, or heat up anything that isn't BBQ-compatible.

I was thinking this year, to get a camping dutch oven, a tripod, and a kettle that can be used too - and attempt to get it all done with wood fire. 

I have a few questions though, if it's that's OK? 

- As a vegetarian, my girlfriend isn't particularly interested in all the delicious slow cooked smokey meat dishes one could make in a dutch oven, so I think I'm going to be limited to stews, soups, cowboy beans, etc.  ? Does anyone have any suggestions on the KIND of thing I can cook in the dutch oven (as opposed to on a bbq normally) ? 

- Assuming the fire was going the night before, how long will it take to get one going big enough to get a kettle boiling in the morning?",Dutch Oven + Tripod + Kettle - worth it?

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and have two pups. I‚Äôm looking for
- plenty of space for my gear
- room for a queen/full size blow up mattress
- head clearance
- ‚Äúoutside‚Äù living space 

Here‚Äôs my two favorite tents:

Coleman Evanston 6
- Pros
‚Äî easy to set up by myself
‚Äî plenty of room inside
‚Äî head clearance
‚Äî lasted forever. 
- Cons
‚Äî the front ‚Äúoutside‚Äù room doesn‚Äôt have window covers. When it rains everything gets wet. It‚Äôs also not big enough to actually be useful, although maybe I‚Äôd feel differently if it stayed dry
‚Äî head clearance works for me but not others would are taller than me

NTK tent. Model discontinued. It‚Äôs like a cross between the Arizona and Indy
- Pros
‚Äî great ‚Äúoutside‚Äù room. Open to the ground. Kind of wish it was a tub floor, but only kind of. Has window coverings that zip tight and it stays dry inside even in heavy rains with the open floor. 
‚Äî massive amount of space
‚Äî stays very dry
‚Äî actually easy to put away
‚Äî great head clearance
-Cons 
‚Äî this thing is massive. It needs 3 people at a minimum to put up and I need a freakin step stool to get it up.
‚Äî very difficult to put up. I‚Äôve put it up a dozen times and it still leaves me frustrated by the time it‚Äôs standing
‚Äî the sleeping area is 1/2 an octagon shape (the outdoor space is the other 1/2) and, while it provides great space, it is awkward space. 
‚Äî the footprint on this thing is beyond obnoxious

I‚Äôve had lots of other tents, but none worth comparing since I‚Äôm looking for something in the middle of these two. I‚Äôd rather not drop $400/$500. I‚Äôd rather stay in the $250 range but I can be flexible.

Tick season typically lasts until mid to late June here, but I would love to be able to get out and enjoy some time in the outdoors before that.

Does anyone know of any areas in Manitoba, Western Canada, or Northwestern Ontario where ticks are not such a big issue?

Of course COVID will have some say in what we‚Äôre able to do but it would be nice to know of some options that might be viable. Will drive as far West as Yoho or as far East as Sleeping Giant if needed.",Avoiding ticks in Manitoba/Canada

camping,"In Colorado there's plenty of spots to pitch a tent amd plenty of places for our huskies to explore. But our old 4 person tent is getting cramped and our 3 huskies don't like being too far from us at night. And this season my wife will be pregnant so the more room and comfort, The better. Not to mention gear and all that we don't leave in the jeep.

It's time tk upgrade anyway and I'm looking over the cabin family tents for us. I dont have a grand to throw into a top end one. And we see the mountains maybe once a month for a weekend when my job isn't in the way of it. 

I've been lookin at things like the Ozark Trail Spring Lodge. I like the room divider since we also have friends that like to come and we play card games and stuff unless we catch a rain outside, amd the dogs would have plenty of space to explore. I like the closet amd extra storage areas too.

Are these things worth it in that style yet? Or have you used that one or have a recommendation for us? Thanks guys!

I would love to go backpacking for a good 6-7 days, preferably in the backcountry. I live in Reno so could drive as far south as Fresno or Yosemite or Sequoia National Forest. I could also drive as far north as the CA/OR border and similar. I doubt much of the Tahoe Rim Trail is accessible or available for anything outside of advanced skills. I consider myself an intermediate winter backpacker.

It‚Äôs my first winter out here, but not my first time winter camping experience. Any suggestions on some place I could drive to, park the truck, and then spend a good 5-6 days backpacking a loop type trail or a out and back trail? I figure, with snow shoes, I can likely cover 8-10 miles a day pretty easy but wouldn‚Äôt want to stretch further than 12 miles in a day due to shortened days. Let‚Äôs keep it it 10 a day to be on the safe side. If the trails are clear, and no shoe shows required (just hiking boots and microspikes or crampons), I could cover 12-15 but don‚Äôt want to stretch it further than that.

So are there any 40-70 mile loop trails in the central to Northern California area for someone who is realistically an intermediate winter backpacker (well past beginner but wouldn‚Äôt consider myself advanced)?

I've got a 24 foot Aerolite Cub 236 2003 that i want to bring cold weather camping which means i will obviously need the heater. The camper currently only has 1 battery and from what i have read, the one battery will not last the entire night without possibly damaging the battery. If i add a second battery, and i make sure they are charged with the generator prior to night time, should i easily get through the night of running the heater? My generator is kind of loud and i don't want to have to run it all night and irritate everyone else out there camping.

Some additional Details - The camper has two tents for the beds which i know will make it harder to warm, outside temps will be around 30 degrees F. and i was planning on setting the thermostat to 65ish.

I ask this because i do not want to invest in a bigger battery box, bracket, and an extra battery if i will still run the risk of not making an entire night with heat or with damaging the batteries.

camping,,"She Finally Came In! My new Estwing Special 17"" camping hatchet. Pictured with my trusty handmade damascus pocket knife (~discussion of gear choices, elitism, extreme mod pedantry, and determination within~long read)::pen for scale::"
camping,"Well, since I wasn't able to gain the information, comparison, and discussion that I originally sought, I thought I'd post this in a few other subs in an attempt to get advice from people that know what the hell they're talking about when it comes to a chunk of steel.  So let's talk turkey, and if you feel like some morning mod-drama, read further:   

TL:DR:  Cool Axe and a knife, Let's talk about it.  


I'm not going to name name's and call out specific subreddits, so I'll just set the stage like this:  About a year ago, I lost my job due to being at high risk to Covid because of extreme lung conditions and a close-contact family member who literally has no immune system from chemo treatments for lung cancer.  Since I'm almost totally isolated and have huge Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD mental scars from being tortured as a child, I knew going into this, that the only way I was going to keep the demons at bay (and keep myself alive) was to work...  and boy did I work.  

Among many *many* other things, a large facet of my learning experience has been survival and self-sufficiency.  I went about constructing a huge urban garden around my property, learning how to fish with lures, hunt with a slingshot, and craft traps and shelters out of wood found in the forest, using only my trusty pocket knife and an axe.  

So I posted this picture on a subreddit where I thought I'd get the best information surrounding the subjects I've been striving all year to learn.  I even saw a post on the front page of that sub that was almost exactly like my post, although to be fair, I also wanted to talk about the workings of my beloved pocket-knife, so I included that in the picture too...  

#DENIED. 

My post, the message said, did not live up to the stringent measures put in place on that sub to keep out vanity photos better meant for ""Instagrammy type pictures"".  So I messaged back:  Hey, I wanted to talk about gear with the other members, and since there's already a post of the same type on the front page, why not let mine through too?  

I got a reply:  

&gt;A difference is that the other Poster wrote a full comment to accompany the picture post.  Not really sure what the point of the pen and a 'decorative knife' is, so NOT literally the same type. 

Oh ok, no big deal. I plan on commenting too, I replied, as my axe came in with a defect that needed fixing, and I wanted other people to know that too before making a purchase.  The pen is for scale, obviously, and the knife was the tool I've been using all year, it wasn't some mall-ninja 'decorative' knockoff, but a fully functional tool that, as I said before, I wanted to discuss the in's and out's of, for people that might like to get one of their own in the future.  Kind of elitist of him to assume the latter, I thought.  

&gt;Rulers are for scale. Or coins that people are familiar with. Or even jokingly - a banana. Axes are sold by weight and haft length - which you would know having just bought the item.  

So... I... didn't use the method of scale you prefer? But the axe's length is right in the title?  

&gt;The pen is redundant. And pens vary in length - unless somebody recognises that particular one, it doesn't help in an appreciation of scale.  

So... the pen is at the same time a redundancy of the scale stated in the title, but also *not good enough* for people to recognise it's size?  It's a damn Bic pen!  Bic Pens come in *fewer sizes* than coins do... who doesn't know how big a Bic pen is?

&gt;The knife is unrelated to the Comment. Pictures should be used to illustrate your text contribution.  

But... it's right there in the title, d00d...

&gt;If there is a fault with the axe, then your picture needs to clearly show the issue. It doesn't.  

Ok... well the axe just had a bad burr on the edge, so I couldn't exactly show that, but again, I'll happily go over that in the comment section so people know.  

&gt;But this ""burr"" was not mentioned in your title: "" ... Great heft, great split"". Where's the picture of the split? Presumably you will be returning the item to the manufacturer or retailer, though they may ask why you continued to use a defective item.  

I was referring it's 'wood splitting' ability... why would I refer to a defect in the axe as 'Great'?  This is **the third** axe I've received after returning two others for being more 'decorative' than I thought it was, and the other's head bending over like a taco after splitting one piece of wood.  Since it was just a burr anyways, I just shaved it off with my grind stone.  Surely it would be helpful for other people to know this, along with information regarding the shoddy axes they shouldn't waste their money on?  

&gt;The knife was pictured to have conversation about gear in a Post about an ax?  The knife is unrelated to the Comment. As explained before - Pictures should be used to ***illustrate*** your text contribution.  I'm sure the maker intended it to be ""decorative"". It's far from a sharpened prybar lump of steel, isn't it?

It's... in the title... *and* the pict... oh never mind...  but thanks for the elitism *again*.

&gt;There seems to be something of a gap between your expectations of the subreddit, and the reality. Whilst I appreciate the length of time since the reddit account you post from was first registered, you may have missed the development and refinement of this particular subreddit during that time. Perhaps a better match may be found elsewhere on reddit?  

No, dude... I don't think there was any gap in expectations, my post fits the subreddit's intentions perfectly.  I wanted a discussion about wood carving tools, and I got an endless litany of caveats you pulled out of your ass to make yourself the 'debate victor'.  Looks like the *true* intentions of your sub is to pick apart other people's posts **for your own vanity**.  Have fun lording over your precious subreddit...doesn't know how big a Bic pen is?

camping,"Hi All,

My mom has difficulty walking long distances, past knee surgery, and I've been contemplating on how to take her camping since she has never gone camping/hiking. She requires assistance entering or exiting vehicles with high clearance, going over tall curbs, or anything tall which involves bending the knee.

There are many people reselling them online; however, I have a few concerns.  First, the resellers are marking up the prices significantly...most are near the price of new containers.  Second, there's really no telling what may have been stored inside them while they were in the possession of the reseller(s).  The market appears to be flooded with blue barrels which were used to store diabetes medicine, which renders the barrels no longer safe for containing food...however, the resellers don't seem to be overly concerned about that.  Isn't the point of these barrels generally to store food? Am I being overly cautious? 

My question, then: where can I go to buy straight-up food grade barrels from a reputable source?

These barrel systems are popular for people doing river trips, and I know a few of you have probably already dealt with these questions. Thanks in advance for any insights you may have!","Finding safe, refurbished/renewed food grade blue barrels"

camping,"I'm interested in camping for free (or cheap as possible) in areas I have not yet explored. Mostly in Utah if that matters. I would like to take advantage of BLM land when beginning my camping trips by car, but it is a bit intimidating driving 2+ hours, not knowing if you can safely and legally camp in a spot identifiable as BLM land from a map.

Basic google research tells me that I can camp anywhere on BLM land with certain restrictions. But I am concerned with the information the blm.gov website doesn't give me. They would have me believe I can camp almost anywhere on BLM land without a permit, but I have heard stories of people getting ticketed for camping on BLM land, or particular areas being unsuitable for camping. I know BLM land is free and I'm not going to be able to just drive in and have a picnic and firepit waiting for me (although for some it does seem that easy), but I can't be the only one to boondock in unfamiliar places on BLM land.

So I guess my question is, how do y'all get peace of mind when picking a spot to camp in the wilderness when far from home? Are there any specific apps or communities or websites you recommend? Are the blm.gov maps up to date? 

Again, I know BLM land isn't going to have the same luxuries of renting a pull-in spot at a KOA, but people seem to have success boondocking and car camping on BLM land. For my specific purposes I would be tent camping within a mile or so from my car (has 4x4), but I use the term car-camping because it's not BLM land I am familiar with, and I have to deal with parking my car somewhere.

So, any help would be appreciated.

camping,"Went winter camping with my girlfriend. Thrilling experience but got a few tips that could help others. We had green spruce branches under us as well as sheep fur. We combined our sleeping bags together, got blanket over us and 2 layers of every clothing... We had simple tarp above us.

About wood:

* Most of the wood will be dry since there is no liquid water in winter so you will have no problem finding some spruce branches for starting the fire.
* Wood is dry, but hard to find... Most of the wood is covered by thick blanket of snow so your main source of wood will be standing/fallen trees
* Thus... 2 hands : 1 axe is a good ratio... thank me later...
* You won't have fire in the night... so deal with it...

Camping:

* Good ground isolation is absolute must!
* Another ones body warm is great but sleeping is worse then...
* Your roof will probably get damp from your breath so keep that in mind...

And also... most of your things that you plan to do won't probably be doable since you will be cold af, we planned on heating some stones to keep us warm during night... But we survived, got ideas for better next time... So hope this helps someone else too ;)

I had been in the market for a rotomolded cooler for a while. I looked at all the big brands like Yeti and Pelican as well as some options we have readily available here like Woods and ProFrost. I needed a large capacity cooler because at times we will have up to 6 people using it at once. After seeing one in person I ended up going with a Whiterock cooler (TRK78). The build quality matches that of all the top end brands but what really set it apart was it's latch system. It has this 2 stage ""detent"" that not only seems to really set the seal perfectly but also makes opening and closing so much easier. 

I have only done some preliminary tests with it at home but I will eventually be doing some side by side comparisons this spring with some bigger name brands and see how it performs. First impressions though are really solid!

The tent is big enough for 3 comfortably but inevitably, when sharing the tent I brush up against the edges of the frost covered tent walls. Is there a way to prevent the frost from building up along the walls of the tent? I had read vending is a necessary thing to do and last trip we slept with the window on the door opened.

Whether you're heading off to the park for a weekend picnic or you want something to stop your lunch from turning into a warm soggy mess before your lunch break at the office or college, a decent food cooler bag is essential. There are several types of coolers, the main ones which are made from hard molded plastic or strong synthetic fiber.

Most people have a cooler that is hard, which can mean heavy or bulky, making its' mobility limited. Here, MIER soft cooler made from durable fabric with thick insulating materials, but they are more lightweight, practical, easily packing away when not in use. Even more, most [MIER cooler bags](https://www.miersports.com/collections/coolers-lunch-bags) Inside using heat-welded seams to prevent flexible liner leaks, very easy to clean when spilled juice/soup.  


So how to choose the best cooler for yourself? There are some points for you chosen:  


* Thicker insulating linings generally work better and look out for fastenings such as strong zips to help keep the air out.
* Name brand cooler, which is using food-grade material.
* The Interior is heat-welded seams so that it can prevent leaks.
* Solid stitching reinforcement on all stress point, especially the shoulder strap.
* Easy to foldable and store.

To understand this, you need to look at all aspects of a cooler. All in all, we need to measure performance ‚Äî how cold it stayed, how easily it loaded, how durable it was against leaks, how comfortable it was to carry. So interesting!

I own a canvas bell tent for when i go camping (or more often larping) and i was looking to invest in some equipment this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at getting a in tent heater but not really sure about the best options out there and it will need to be suitable for use in the months of Late November and December. I know propane heating is out because it's really bad circulation in the tent and carbon dioxide.

&amp;#x200B;

I have alternatively been looking at a hand cranked/solar panelled battery pack which has a usb port in it. To have one of the small office/desk heaters. However i don't know how reliable and useful a small heater such as that is.

More often than not we never have an electrical port because we are camping right in the middle of the woods so it needs to be something portable and the like.

camping,"**Cold winds:**

In all my previous camping trips in winter, I must have been lucky to not having much wind, that luck ended the last few days. With day temp being a cozy -10 deg C, and night time towards -19 deg C, sitting by the campfire did not warm my feet. I also could not literally warm my boots too close to the fire, maybe risking the glue and the plastic on my boots coming undone. I realized then that a single layer of wool socks probably wasn't enough. Seems like I would have to consider buying some larger boots that I can use with two pairs of socks + a plastic bag inside.

&amp;#x200B;

**Boots:**

Ugh, I need better/larger boots in winter that is warmer. A single medium thick wool socks isn't warm enough for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drying socks and failing:**

I tired two times to dry my wool socks at the campfire. Once at the side of the flames, and the other time lower at the side of the hot coals. Both times my socks melted and either turned into stiff plastic, or became so brittle, and two socks of different pair ended up with a hole in them. :(

&amp;#x200B;

**De-icing my tent:**

On a positive note, I managed to de-frost my tent after a couple of days out in the cold. I very carefully, used a trangia spirit burner with full fuel, and burned that on the trangia triangle stand, on top of a plastic thingy so it all wouldn't risk melt the bottom or slide around. **I made sure to stand outside the tent during the burning as I had no idea just how dangerous it might be re. toxic carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.** The flame was not hot/high enough to damage the top of the tent. It was surprising to see that the interior temperatur rose to what must have been +10 or warmer, also making sure I have some ventilation going on. I manage to defrost most of the interior in a single burn, with some small stuff left in the corners.

Edit: I should keep better eye on things, because just because I managed to de-ice the tent once, maybe it won't work as well the next time. Only did it once.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spirit burner fuel:**

I made sure to bring an excess amount of spirit burner fuel, and I am happy having done that, never really having to worry too much about running out anytime soon when making food.

&amp;#x200B;

**A relaxing campfire:**

Well, assuming there isn't any wind, it is a good idea to floss/brush teeth and eating food and whatever by the campfire, instead of doing that later in the cold. Melting a little snow on the fire is also fairly trivial, and doesn't have to reach boiling point for brushing one's teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Changing clothes in the cold:**

I like changing first the top side, and then the pants side, while being in my sleeping bag, either in the evening, or early in the morning before I get up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thawing food by the campfire:**

So, thawing food by the campfire was simple enough, I just had to be a little patient. Also, bad idea placing hot dog buns inside my jacket, three of them became squished. :) Also, thawing a small bottle of mustard, I had no patience for that. Placing the small bottle of ketchup some time before eating, made most of the ketchup liquid and usable. To my surprise, the ""beer sticks"" (meat) that I had brought with me, had not frozen, and could be eaten as such without warming them up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Failing to dry my sleeping bag:**

So, after some time out in the freezing cold, I can't help breath onto the top part of the sleeping bag, and that stuff turns to ice. Afaik, that icy part is not a big issue, but still, hanging my sleepin bag to dry outside, there was too much shade and hardly any sun shone onto the sleeping bag, and with the sun being so low this time of the year, I gave up drying to dry the sleeipng bag in the sun, and brought it home instead. :| I have no idea how damp if at all my sleeping bag was, probably not an issue, but then again, I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Added:** I have for the previous two weeks been in and out of the woods, either camping or just being out in the cold, and looking at my toes, two are blue (the ones beside the big toe), and should they fall off, it is an improvement, from when I was camping out in -5 deg C, and lose two big toe nails, and the two beside. I actucally had to yank them off, because they did not want to fall off by themselves. :| My last bad camping trip in 2018, my other shoes became wet and very cold from goofing around in the powdery snow (just wool socks inside autumn boots), and I was unable to start a fire the first day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bacon:**

Frozen. Bacon.  Hard to manage unless you go for thawing the whole package. Probably best to protion at home, before it all gets frozen hard. I sort of managed, and had bacon wrapped hot dogs with sesame seed buns. :) I also brought lompe because there were 8 buns for my 9 hot dogs. I also brought tortillas for my re-hydrated hot meals, but I never used any and took them home. They too ofc were frozen, but with lompe it was rather easy to separate into individual pieces when frozen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Snow brush thingy:**

So, I brought along a snow brush for a car and it worked nicely for cleaning off snow from the oversnowed campsite and also boots and tent.",I learned some new things duing winter camping

Hi! My girlfriend and I are camping down in Turkey and starting 21:00 yesterday, a stray dog has been barking and growling at the entrance of our tent. There seems to be a massive pack patrolling the forest.

We figured it'd just leave eventually, but guess what: it is still here 11 hours later... 

Any advice? Would it be a better idea to just get out of the tent completely so we can scare it off and give fighting it off a better chance (in the case that may be necessary) or should we take a more slow and friendly approach?

I would usually go for a friendly approach, but this dog is clearly very upset with our presence. We're not scared of dogs, but would prefer to keep our limbs intact.

camping,"Having spend literally decades traveling and living in all kinds of places like sailboats, vehicles, etc, .. one thing I've learned is that if its hot I can sleep pretty much anywhere as long as I have some kind of fan blowing on me.  Fans keep the air moving over your body and allows your body to use its ability to perspire to keep you cool.  So now I want to start researching to find something that is long lasting, light weight, easy to travel with, and flexible power (which probably means USB if the fan has enough air flow to be useful ..).

Love to hear your thoughts and recommendations.

Edit, also not as interested in fans with integrated rechargeable batteries because I prefer to centralized battery power ..","Planning for summer ..

I cant even tell you where I got it from. I always thought it was an old military tent. I was told all the pieces were in the bag but I have NEVER been able to erect the tent. I have had several ppl throughout the years try and figure it out with me, but to no avail. My only option now is to find the model and buy replacement poles or fashion my own some how. I am not too knowledgeable about vintage, canvas tents. I was a boy scout, grew up in the military so Im no stranger to the outdoors or tents that I have grown up with. But i am hoping to find some one with some info on this tent. I have pictures and because reddit is so picky with posting pictures, I will def send some in email.

Color - Green and beige

5-8 man tent (Large)

Canvas with 2 side windows, split zipper door and a tarp type bottom.

Very heavy duty. 

No logos on the tent ANYWHERE

Only a metal tag embossed with the tent model number (which I have searched and searched for to the ends of the interwebs with no avail)

It's listed on google maps, there's a couple sparse entries about it if you search for it.

There's two reviews on the google listing and they're fairly recent, saying it's an awesome spot, but that's about all there is. It looks like an incredible location.

camping,"I think I can conclude that I do not prefer winter camping in -20 deg C. 

I think I would prefer -5 deg C or -10 deg C.

In -14 deg C, I had a fairly good time in my sleeping bag, having a sleeping bag that should be ""usable"" down to -25 deg C. However at -20 deg C I could feel a chill presumably from the zipper line, which was only covered by some thinner bit of fabric and maybe a little filling.

Changing clothing in -20 deg C was surprisingly ok, probably helped by having dry clothing available ofc.

Putting on ""ice cold"" boots in -20 deg C, was also surprisingly trivial, and did not feel freezing cold, because I had dry socks and also had been previously using a shopping bag around each foot out in the cold.

By the campfire I got smoke in my eyes and I got tears in my eyes, and I felt my eyelashes starting to freeze. :D

My campfire lit up with one match though (firestarter heh), as I had been careful using dry wood only. I found some possibly non-dry wood from a fallen tree that blocked a trail and had to be sawed off, so I put two long logs at the bottom of the campfire to better reflect the heat and eventually those too at the bottom started to burn.

I was happy I had been using an assortment of hand liners, gloves and mittens, incl. thin water proof construction worker gloves.

When I got up in the night, feeling the chill in -20 deg C, and I had to take a piss, I had to make a decision if I wanted to try go at it, for the next 6 hours, or just walk home, so I walked home. :)

I had also been using a 1+ liter hot water flask (w. proper screw plug), and I noticed that the bag was still moderately warm after 6 hours being in the sleeping bag, but even with the hot water flask, the chill I felt was not fun and I wasn't sure what was wrong. Could be that it was the zipper area, or, that my neck strap did not fully seal my upper part of the body, even though I tried to make sure I had a tight fit.

I will now probably camp in less freezing conditiosn and also look into what a better sleeping bag might look like.",-20 C camping woes

camping,"Hey everybody,

Noob camper here. I‚Äôm taking my family (wife and 3 young children) camping in a couple weeks at Sam Houston National Forest. It will be my first time truly camping, but as we are moving to Denver in a few months, and intend to really get into more outdoor living with the kids, we figured this would be a good start. While I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience camping, I do consider myself to be relatively capable outdoors, so I‚Äôm looking forward to finding out how right or wrong I am.

We have most of the essentials taken care of already (tent, sleep mat and bags, and various other items), but the one thing I‚Äôm very curious about is food. Option 1 is obviously to just bring a cooler and make sandwiches, but I‚Äôd like to cook at least 1 might. My wife thinks we need to just buy a stove, while I‚Äôd prefer to try cooking over a campfire. I‚Äôd be interested to know how much of a learning curve there is to cooking with a fire.

camping," TL/DR: just curious what others do in regards to campsite layout to fend off critters.

I‚Äôve grilled tasty smelling foods on grills and made stews in Dutch ovens for most of my camping life. With that even though food and garbage was stored in the car after dinner my campsites were typically visited by various scavenging omnivores during the night. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was the remnants of cooking grease that attracted them.

They would come check out the tent even though I would wear different clothes than I cooked in. I would hear stuff get knocked over outside the tent, you know typical stuff.

I tried an experiment the last five campouts. I was hiking / dispersed camping. My fire and cook area was at least a hundred feet away from my sleep area. Plus I only made easy meals with a single pot and an alcohol stove. Nothing with a heavy aroma but yet still tasty. I left no food bits behind as is my general practice. My food bag was hung somewhere between the cooking area and my hammock.

The only animals that I encountered were deer. In one case there were a pair of bucks running around a nearby clearing snorting and clicking at each other in the full overhead moonlight.

The other was a deer at dawn who saw my hammock and kept smacking his hoof on the ground while he stared at me. Both truly cool experiences.

Other than that, no trash pandas, bears or anything bothered my campsite at night.

camping,"I just picked up a new 4-season bivy and want to try it out in the snow. The location I was planning on testing it out is a campground in the summer, but in the winter it's mostly unused. It's right beside a fairly busy cross-country skiing trail and a snowshoe trail, about 2-3 hours by snowshoe from a ski resort.

The problem I have is that the new bivy is bright orange and kinda looks like an emergency shelter. I'm worried that someone might see me from one of the trails and think I'm in trouble. Is there a good way to mark the site and make it look like I'm there intentionally? My plan is to dig a trench to sleep in (for the wind) and then mark around it with flagging tape on sticks so I don't get stepped on if it snows. I'll also have my rucksack and snowshoes there outside the bivy which might help.

I still want to be fairly visible so that I can be found easily if something goes wrong and I don't return when I'm supposed to, but I also don't really want to be bothered if everything is fine.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Am I just overthinking it? Any advice is appreciated.",Worried about bivy bag looking like an emergency

This tent can serve as (A) bonafide camping gear, or (B) a cheap shelter that we can bring along if we decide to include other people and have (by then) bought a better separate tent for ourselves.

I think [this Stoic Driftwood 3](https://www.steepandcheap.com/stoic-driftwood-3-tent-3-person-3-season) would serve well for (A), while [this Wakeman 6-person](https://www.overstock.com/Sports-Toys/6-Person-Tent-Water-Resistant-Dome-Tent-for-Camping-With-Removable-Rain-Fly-And-Carry-Bag-Blue-By-Wakeman-Outdoors/15439589/product.html?refccid=6JIEM6DEDS6LGGSBC5I54SFTCM&amp;searchidx=39&amp;kwds=camping%20tents&amp;rfmt=top_rated%3ATop%20Rated) seems to fulfill the goals of (B).

For the sake of my uses for V-day, spaciousness, and comfort is more important to me than durability/quality/utility - which is why I'm even considering the Wakeman.  What I'm looking for by way of feedback is whether the I should dismiss the Wakeman entirely because it's crap, or whether I should skip on the Stoic because I'll probably find a good deal on a good quality 2-3 person tent in the future.

Worse still, I spent two hours unable to get a campfire started at -14 deg C the next morning. Luckily I could make warm food by boiling water. The sleeping bag was warm, so that was nice, but the nose got cold. I will try bring  a filter mask and cut holes in it, to protect the nose a little while not really blocking air, maybe that will help keep the nose warmer. I even wore a bakalava, but it only has a small piece of fabric covering the nose and the bakalava (face mask) wasn't enough to keep the nose warm.

I did not want to quit, but I can't stay out there atm, so I went home without my gear, but I did take the time to stopming up a path through the snow the final 10% of the way. Luckily I managed to find the unmarked trail spot on, a second time, after the second snow fall, so that was fun. Some snapped branches indicates where the trail goes, but those marker aren't everywhere.

I think I will stay home for a few days and get back out, hopefully after the weather gets a little warmer, in some days it will be -15 outside, and probalby -18 in the forest.

I also had a firebox that I failed to light, so I made sure to bring it home, loosing a kilo of weight from my backpack that way. I also noticed that I had somehow brought ten pegs, probably another 200-300g weight I brought home as well. I don't need the tent pegs in winter.

I will go out again soon and bring more spirit fuel, firestarters and a woolen sweater, lots of matches and most importantly, plenty of plain woolen socks (not the thick one I already sleep with those).

So, btw, I tried out a new thing on this trip. Using leather boots, in addition to adding the goo to try seal the leather from water a couple of days before, I also used to shopping bags in plastic, in my boots. This I think helped me keeping me more warm, preventing sweat to soak the leather boots on the inside. It worked nicely. I also use various soles. Foam soal which is comfy, and soles for better insulation and warmth.","Had to quit sort of, things didn't go as planned (backpacking)"

Good day friends! Thanks in advance for those who take the time to read. :)  

I  have recently decided to bring my dream of camping in my car to life to travel around and have stumbled into the realm of roof top tents. The one I have my  eye on is the  [Tepui Kekenam 3](https://tepui.com/products/thule-tepui-explorer-kukenam-3). It looks like a good choice with the cons being mostly quality of life stuff. My issue is justifying the  price when I could just work on building out a frame for the inside to  sleep on with some storage underneath. However, sleeping inside the car brings about worries of not having enough storage in some situations which makes me lean more towards the roof top.

My question is: What is your experience with your roof top tent?

What is the biggest issue you have had with the tent?

Any recommendations or other options around the same price or lower?

If you could do it again, would you go with a difference setup?

camping,"I went camping this past weekend for the first time after buying some gear from REI. Did it alone and had a good time reading and playing on my Gameboy. The campsite I stayed at was right on the Potomac river separating Maryland and Virginia which was pretty cool. It was the type you park a little ways away and have to carry your stuff to the site.  
  
Was just curious from others with more experience about tricks for dealing with the cold. I got a pretty good sleeping bag that's rated for 18 degrees and a sleeping pad, but could still feel the cold ground underneath (Lows were in the mid 20s) Had on a bunch of layers with wool bottoms and top. I was up for about an hour around 4am feeling pretty chilly even with the bag drawstring closed around my head. I also had an issue where the breath from my nose was condensing on the outside of the sleeping bag and dripping back down onto my neck! Do folks double up and use two sleeping pads in the winter? How does one deal with condensation in the tent? I had the rainfly all the way closed most of the night to try to keep some warmth in and wind out but after noticing the condensation issue I unzipped it a little.  Also getting a sleeping bag back into it's little carrying sack is the most frustrating thing imaginable.
  
Here's a picture of my site and reading by the river! I had a good time and hope to take what I've learned to have an even better time the next trip.  Eventually I'd like to start doing some hiking/camping trips but have to figure out what to do about carrying multiple day's worth of food first. I probably also need one of those camp stove deals but then that's even more stuff to carry. Thanks for reading.

camping,"We have a rather grand tent that we use a double high air mat ress in with an attached vestibule. It's really great, we've been happy with it, but due to some wind damage and what is shaping up to be a permanently bum leg, we're exploring other options. 

We chose such a big tent because my husband is 6'3"" and it's nice he doesn't have to bend over. But really, we only use the tent for sleeping/storing things we dont want condensation to gather on in the early morning. 

Here's our thought process:

Currently we pack up my 98 Camry to the brim. It works, it's just my husband and me. But our trips are usually: find a camp spot, pitch the tent, unload the suitcase/cooler/toiletry bag/camp stove/air mattress/bedding so we don't have a full car while we explore the area/find local firewood and have room to transport it. 

So, we started thinking of a little trailer to put that stuff in that we can just drop off in the morning, do our fun stuff, and then come back to set up. 

Which led to thinkin: my car's not gonna last forever no matter how good a mechanic my husband is. And he's a professional! Coupled with I had an ACL reconstruction a year ago that resulted in nerve damage to my shin; I can't kneel or even have pressure on 75% of my lower leg. So rolling the tent is stupidly funny with me trying to apply pressure with my boobs and elbows. We began to think - we don't use the tent for anything but sleeping. Why couldn't we use a little trailer  that has secured storage as well as a bed? Something that we can leave packed during the week, and just grab the cooler and head out Saturday morning? 

It also appeals to our desire to try a little winter camping. 

We looked at teardrop trailers but they have way more than we need. We don't need a kitchen area, AC, battery bank, shower, or toilet.  

My Camry has a hitch, but my next vehicle will be bigger. Maybe an SUV but I'm leaning towards a small pickup. So I'd have increased towing capacity. 

Is there a subreddit, or even a good thread, that would be in line with what I've described here?

Turns out there is in my area about 20-40 deep snow.

One task today was to trod a path through the snow to find my way later, and this works nicely as long as there doesn't come much more snow on top of the old.

Another task is actually finding a way through the forest without spending any excess time finding my way.

I managed to find my way, and it was a good thing I had a compass with me, as I knew I shouldn't try move too much to neither west or east. Not only did I manage to hit precisely this one stone on the path that I am used to seeing, I also hit right on the spot where the non marked trail ends on a crossing marked trail, so that was great fun.

Anyway, I spent some 4 hours making my way to my location, where I normally use some 80 minutes.

I spent some 6 hours walking around today and I am exhausted. :)

Because it is winter I had to bring a headlight, just in case it got dark when I was still out in the woods.

Despite me sloshing around in powder snow for hours, my pants nor my boots seems to get wet, probably because I had an insulating layer inside my pants and also venting my pants on the side to have the excess heat escape.",I am glad I checked out my camping spot ahead of time.

**Getting creative**

My family was never one of those families that went on exotic vacations a few times a year. While we couldn‚Äôt afford a spring break in Florida, my parents still found creative ways to take my sister and I traveling when we were little.

As a result, we explored our natural neighborhood in the beautiful state of Wisconsin by way of a few campgrounds every summer.

Years later, I am so grateful for these summer adventures and the lessons my parents taught me along the way. The importance of community and the importance of nature.

&amp;#x200B;

**2020 taught us so many lessons**  
This past year has been hard for everyone and we‚Äôve all spent more time outside in an effort to keep our family and friends healthy. In so many ways, COVID-19 has been and continues to be, an absolute tragedy. There is no way around that. Loved ones dead. Businesses closed. Jobs lost. The list goes on.

Despite these truths, however, I do think we can learn so much from our experiences this year about how to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Visiting every State Park in Indiana brought me more than just the views**  
Due to COVID, I've been able to visit nearly every State Park in Indiana this year. With travel options nearly erased, my friends I discovered camping as the best way to get out during quarantine. These adventures crisscrossing the state in search of a great hike or campsite provided something to look forward to nearly every week. I‚Äôve made amazing memories and gotten to know my adopted home state in more ways than I ever could have imagined.

Each time I visit a new campground, park, or trail, I can feel myself connecting more deeply with my surroundings. With each step on a challenging hike, I feel more alive and the worries of the workplace fade into insignificance. The brain rests while the soul comes alive with the sound of birds, rushing water, and rustling leaves.  


**What I need to be happy.**  
These moments of clarity exploring the outdoors helped me find myself and what I believe matters. What I need to be happy.  


**It comes down to two rules:**  


Love the people you are with and love yourself.  


If you find the right crew, keep them around.

If you find something you love, keep doing it.  


Everything else will fall into place. For me, by connecting with the outdoors and sharing my love for nature with like-minded individuals, I found what I needed to feel joy in a horrifying year. For you it could be anything.",My friend's awesome story about how camping brought his family together and helped him define happiness for himself in 2020.

camping,"Hello r/camping, I started piecing together a few emergency necessities for my car a few months ago which has ballooned into a bit of a hobby of curating a bug-out-bag.

 1. A good drying place  
Under the [awning](https://www.chinafoldingtent.com) is the best place to dry your clothes. The awning can block the wind and rain, and the lower part can be equipped with a drying rack to dry the clothes, even if it rains suddenly when you are out. More importantly, it can cut off the damage of ultraviolet rays to clothing and prevent clothing from fading and becoming old.

2. Harmony and unity of shading and daylighting  
While shielding the scorching summer, it can reflect strong sunlight into the room in the form of diffused light, so that the indoor light is bright and not dazzling, and does not affect the view from the window outside the room, extending people's living space from the interior Going outdoors creates a new living space.

3. Anti-ultraviolet function  
The sunshade's sunshade cloth has a special anti-ultraviolet function, which not only protects human skin from ultraviolet rays but also greatly extends the service life of indoor decoration and furniture.

There are a variety of patterns and colors of covering cloth. Users can personalize and decorate the window surroundings according to their own tastes. They can also choose the appropriate awning model according to the shape of the building to make the building equipped with the awning of the day The objects are more personalized decoration, thereby enhancing the image of the overall building.",What Is The Role And Function Of The Awning?

„ÄÄ„ÄÄDo it yourself, how to, outdoor life

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe investment [pavilion](https://www.chinafoldingtent.com/) seems a bit expensive, you can only use it in summer and the rest of the year, it sits there, no one uses it. This seems to be a waste of money, but you can never go wrong again. The pavilion can be used all year round, but you must know how to use the pavilion and for what purpose. So go out there, buy a pavilion, and use it all the time in some of the most unusual but awesome ways.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 1-Turn it into an outdoor cinema

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSince the pavilion is already set up, you can easily convert it into a home theater. Drag the TV, CD system, and other speakers to the pavilion for installation, or just buy another set of entertainment equipment (flat screen, soundbar), which can be covered and sealed when not in use.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter the theater opens, organize a party with your friends and family, watch the latest 3D movies, host a sports night, and even watch your favorite shows in this exotic new entertainment venue you created for yourself and your family. Unfavorable weather such as rain or strong wind may prevent you from using the pavilion, but you can invest in heavy-duty PVC solid walls to keep the pavilion warm and safe. Alternatively, you can use the pavilion when the weather is not too severe. Mother Nature does not show her anger every winter night or weekend.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 2-Temporary Shelter

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you have a movable pavilion, you can easily move the pavilion in the hot summer to provide temporary shelter for vehicles. Install a pavilion on the driveway or sidewalk, and then park the car in the shade.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 3-Build a greenhouse

„ÄÄ„ÄÄBuild a small garden in the pavilion to protect the environment. In winter, establish a small garden and plant seasonal vegetables such as potatoes, onions, peppers, eggplants, etc. Don't forget to buy strong or flexible plastic walls to keep the inside of the pavilion warm and moist. With the right heater, you can easily get a comfortable supply of fresh vegetables throughout the winter.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 4-Open a pop-up store

„ÄÄ„ÄÄDo you have a small business? Use it as a pop-up store by setting up temporary pavilions in parking lots, exhibitions, and popular shopping areas. You may need a license or permit, but this is a significant way to increase awareness of local businesses with minimal investment.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 5-Charity Activities

„ÄÄ„ÄÄCharity activities are an excellent way to collect food, money, and clothes for the poor. If you have a portable pavilion, place it near a church, hospital, or any event to promote charitable activities. With the right pavilion, you can attract walkers into the pavilion and encourage them to follow your favorite charity. After all, any kind of contribution can have a huge impact on any non-profit organization.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 6-Temporary storage

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAre you decorating the house? Or do you have to leave your home for a few days because of pests and fog? Use the pavilion as a temporary shelter or a place to temporarily store your property. In summer, this is possible. However, in rainy weather and winter, you may need extra protection. Under these adverse conditions, make sure you have a strong PVC wall to provide temperature control and protect you and your property from strong winds.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 7-Use it as a team-building exercise

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFor seminar organizers, teamwork is a great way to encourage a community atmosphere. Building things together is a great way to encourage team unity, and the pavilion is a perfect choice. In a company seminar, you can divide your colleagues into teams and then compete. The team that built the pavilion received the reward first. This team exercise can encourage unity and ensure mutual communication and better professional ethics between teams. Of course, you can also set the pavilion as an outdoor seating area during business seminars, or set the pavilion as an outdoor snack area during business lunches or events.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 8 ‚Äì Make jazz on the kid‚Äôs birthday party

„ÄÄ„ÄÄChildren like to have fun birthday parties. If you already have a temporary gazebo, hold a pantomime, puppet show, or magic show in the gazebo and make the kids happy throughout the party. You can rent two more pavilions, and hire temporary tattooists, handicraft teachers, etc. Your young guests will have a wonderful time.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 9-Giveaway

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you have a company, the pavilion is a great way to promote your company locally. Created pavilions with logos and distributed them to your vendors as freebies. You can also give it away to customers who shop in your store or customers who win simple daily contests.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄTip 10-beach party

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you organize a beach party, then you know it can be very windy and cold at night. In order to provide temporary protection, please set up a pavilion on the beach and place lounges, rocking chairs, and carpets in the pavilion to relax.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAs you can see, the pavilion is the perfect holiday destination when it comes to relaxing outdoors. Just sitting in the pavilion completely comfortably in the pavilion can provide a multi-purpose investment.",10 Unusual But Great Ways To Use The Gazebo

camping,"I recently bought a truck and I‚Äôm trying to decide how I want to focus my camping set up.

I am also very interested in doing the roof top tent option which would be mounted on a truck bed rack. I love the idea of this because I could then use my truck bed for other items and likely be more comfortable. I would also be able to more comfortably fit another person.

camping,"Another Redditor just posted their pics of backcountry camping in Algonquin Park, and I have a flood of good memories from about 20 years ago in the late 2000's when a handful of buds and I used to go winter camping between Chirstmas and New years each year. I thought I'd share, even though this reddit seems more dedicated to pics than words :)

We never took tents. Back then, hot camping wasn't a thing, and we felt like we could get by without one - but that didn't preclude us taking some other ""creative"" shelters. We weren't much good at lightweight camping. I recall my pack was over 80lbs every time we went. Our clothes were mostly wool and we didn't do ""high tech"" fabrics since we were all broke, and the army surplus store was down the road.  Sleds were a prominent part of our gear.

In year 1 - we thought this was a once in a lifetime adventure, so everyone over planned and overpacked with all sorts of expectations and concerns. We arrived at Algonquin Park at the crack of dawn and hiked back into the woods on the Western Uplands trail (IIRC). Pulling the sleds and hiking in the snow was far harder than we'd anticipated. We moved slower than we thought we would and quickly saw we wouldn't be reaching our intended goal. Eventually we reached Starling Lake and declared it ""home"". 

John pulled out a huge 50'X25' Canadian Tire tarp and we started to talk about how we'd set it up to make a shelter. Eventually we stretched out the tarp on the snow and decided that we'd dig a pit to stretch the tarp over. The pit was dug, and  the tarp stretched out. by time we were done digging, the sun was getting low. It was a warm night for January though. No one was cold, and the snow was getting heavy - there may have even been a light fog. We found some dead trees in the woods and stripped their branches for firewood. The spars that were left, we laid across the pit to hold up the tarp, and lashed a grid together, then stretched the tarp over the trees and crawled inside dragging in our gear behind us. 

As we got the fire going to cook dinner, John produced a large piece of Tyvek housewrap.  We set 4 spars in the ground and made a gazebo as a light drizzle began to fall. As we ate, the drizzle thickened and we became concerned about freezing rain. After a meal of reconstituted dehydrated whatever it was, we all made a run for our shelter to stay dry, and indeed, it was very cosy inside - but the roof didn't have much insulation. We all decided that a quick shoveling session to put snow on the tarp roof would be a good idea. an hour later, the roof had a consistent 6"" layer of snow on it, and everyone headed back inside to dry out.

With about a half-dozen candle-lanterns lighting the space, everyone settled into or onto their sleeping arrangements. With the weight of the snow, the roof was a few inches lower. In the spaces between the spars, the tarp sagged more, but it was all good and warm and comfortable.

It wasn't until after we were asleep that the drizzle became rain. The rain was gentle and silent and we didn't hear it hitting the tarp since the snow muffled the sound. I think it was Jim who woke first. His sleeping bag had soaked through, and he woke up everyone else. The weight of the rain on the tarp had made it sag down to where it was nearly touching me, and the water in the snow pit was coming up from below. I was on a cot about 4"" off the ground and about 1"" from the ceiling and trapped between the water above and the water below. No one was getting out of the snow pit dry, and all of our gear was soaked through.

We all scrambled to the gazebo, which had collapsed with the weight of water. For the rest of the night we would stand outside alternating between trying to rescue our fire (which sank into the ground as it burned) and the gazebo (that kept wanting to tip over with the weight of water it was holding). 

As the night went on, nature was kind to us, and the temperatures dropped below freezing, turning the freezing rain to snow and the water to ice. Eventually, 2 of the guys were able to return to bed, but John and I stayed up tending the fire and the gazebo. 

As soon as the sun reappeared, we got everyone up and assessed how bad things were. I recall my backpack being a frozen brick. That may be incorrect, but for sure it was not in good shape. we decided to dismantle camp and hike back out. Everything weighed extra with all the water. Dis assembling the pit was a mammoth chore with the tarp frozen to the poles. 

Luckily we had food for 4 days and had only stayed 1. We ate well and laughed about our mistakes as we tore camp down. everyone was exhausted. On the way out, the trails were a skiff of snow over a slick of ice, and we all had to lean on each other as we trudged along with packs that were all over 100 lbs.

That year set the tone for all the years of winter camping that followed. It was the first great failed experiment - others would follow including home-made snowshoes falling apart on the trail, a mitten dryer that turned into a blowtorch when put over the fire, The year we arrived too late to build quinzees and ended up sleeping out in the open, the year we took a marine from Florida with us who had never seen snow, and so on. While all of our trips had amazing failures, we never felt like we were in real danger, and always came away laughing and having a great story to share. 

Jim and John are in their late 60's now and no longer camping. I miss going out there with them. I'd do it again in heartbeat.",Winter camping memories

camping,I got the Nomad around three weeks ago and since then I have used it on two camping trips. I want to give you a no bs review so I‚Äôll just list my personal pros and cons about the tool. Pros: it‚Äôs really compact so it takes no effort just to throw it in the bag or put in my wallet. The versatility of this thing is great it has like 13 or so tools (of which I probably use 6) but just cutting down Six tools into one makes the purchase great for me. Now the cons: the weight is more then I thought it would be (this might not necessarily be a bad thing but I just was caught off guard by it) and the knife on the tool is dull so I had to sharpen it on my stone. Overall I would give an 8/10. (https://backpackingmovement.com/products/card-multi-tool),Nomad Multitool Review
camping,"I decided one day that I was going to stop buying duraflame logs since they are a waste of money. Duraflame logs are made of three ingredients. Wax sawdust and seeds (for crackling sounds). 

Apparently a lot of people have sources for free sawdust near them but I can‚Äôt seem to find any of that so I came up with my own recipe. Instead of sawdust I substitute charcoal.


Here is the recipe

Take lump charcoal (home made or store bought) and grind it into a sand like powder using a blender/ food processor.
[tip: use a wire spoon called a spider to pick the coals out of a cold fire, shake off the soot and salvage the charcoal]

Melt wax in an all metal pot or kettle [this is importand] and pour it into a container with the charcoal until it becomes like wet sand when you mix it.

Scoop out the mixture with you hands when it cools down *JUST* enough and scoop it into a sheet of aluminum foil. Wrap the aluminum foil around the pile of charcoal and once fully enclosed, massage into the shape of a loaf/log. Set aside till completely room temp (about an hour for me)

Unwrap loaf from foil and place onto wax paper, wrap wax paper around about 3 times and press sides like a burrito so it is fully enclosed in wax paper.

***here is why it‚Äôs important to use a fully metal pot to melt the wax*** 

You can place the used pot on its side in a fire to burn off the wax and leave behind just soot, that can be easily scrubbed off with Brillo or steel wool with some washing abrasive if needed until all the black is gone.


Now some people don‚Äôt like using paraphin wax becouse some studies show it produces certain unhealthy chemicals when burned. I don‚Äôt have a problem with paraphin wax but if you do then you can use bees wax or if that‚Äôs too expensive use vegetable waxes like soy wax.",I think I figured out the perfect campfire fuel recipe.

camping,"Hey everybody,

I am looking to do a several week road trip through Colorado and Utah now that I am self employed and have freedom over my schedule.

I am a bit of a noob camper, but I would really like to do a lot of car camping in Utah and Colorado after having been stuck in my house for the past year. 

Utah especially seems to be a camping utopia, but there's almost too many spots that come up wherever I search. I'm not sure how to discern which places are actually worthwhile, especially for a bit of a novice camper.

What are your favorite campgrounds to go to in UT and CO? I'll be renting a decent sized car and for parts of the trip I'll have a group of 4 or 6 or so, but I'll also be alone for most of the trip.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",Best campsites in Utah or Colorado?

So.. I ordered this new headwear with fake fur around the top and basically around the face. :) It should be a lot warmer than my old woolen cap, especially around the ears.

Next up, I should probably buy some mittens, because I have no warm gloves that are decent below 0 deg C. :( One can buy wool liners, but ofc, those has to fit inside your gloves or whatever.

camping,"Hi guys. 
So for a while now I‚Äôve had an intense feeling of wanting to run away from what I have now and who I have now and go totally alone with the only worry being food, shelter and safety. I live in the UK, so the only ‚Äúbigger‚Äù forests are in the highlands of Scotland. Scotland also being the only place in the UK where free camping is legal; is why that would be the best destination. Temperatures can and have got to -10 degree Celsius/ 14 Fahrenheit in the winter with snow getting up to 6-14inches in the area I‚Äôm looking at. Weather is typically cold for around 3 months.Unlike Chris I want to be totally prepared with stuff that will keep me alive, especially during winter. And I‚Äôm also thinking long term so how would I keep replacing what I have if they became damaged etc etc. So many things popping up in my head which is probably telling me not to, but it‚Äôs making me so so happy and purposeful thinking about it. Shelter, warmth water I think would be the main important thing,  then obviously food. We don‚Äôt have the diversity of animals the US does so that‚Äôs a small worry of mine, although we also don‚Äôt have many predatory animals to worry about. I‚Äôve thought about building a shelter into a save kinda thing like you see on the primitive videos on YouTube, except mine won‚Äôt be fancy water falls lol. Also building a fire place with a working fire/chimney . I don‚Äôt have hunting skills, actually none at all so advise there will be good especially traps as that‚Äôs taken my interest. Idk what I‚Äôm asking really I‚Äôm just asking for any advise you guys can throw at me, few things I‚Äôve mentioned as you‚Äôve read if you could help with those. I know it‚Äôs a bad idea but I want to and I plan to for as long as I can... is that do able ? Never coming back?",Planning to go ‚ÄúInto The Wild‚Äù

My dates are June 18th to July 9th and can post a more detailed itinerary if needed. I know this sub is for camping in general but if anyone has an idea of a better one for these questions please let me know. 

1. My first stop is Grand Teton NP, I'm leaving from Northern Colorado and expecting to get to Grand Teton around 2 or 3pm- is all hope lost at trying to find a FF campsite? Some of the stuff I've read says that Gros Venture and Lizard Creek would be my best bet but I'm worried I won't get a spot. 
2. I have about 1 and 1/2 days in Yellowstone (I know it's not nearly enough time), but what are the realistic ""must see's"" in that timeframe? I'm staying in the Madison Campground if that helps.
3. I'll arrive in Glacier on 6/23 and am worried that going to the sun road won't be open. Any suggestions on other areas to see/explore if this road isn't open? I also haven't made reservations here but am leaning towards Many Glaciers or St. Marys campgrounds- any input on those?
4. After I hit North Cascades and Mt. Rainier I'm heading to Olympic and realized that I am not going to have nearly enough time to even see the highlights. My current plan is to stay at the Kalaloch Campground and try to see the HOH rainforest and some of the beaches. Is there anything else I should try to see on the south side? Or a better way to spend my 1 1/2 days? 
5. I will be in Salem Oregon for the 4th of July as an in between- is there anything special I should see while there? I'm just staying the night so I won't have a ton of time there! 

I know that I'm trying to pack a lot into a short amount of time but I'm really hoping to see as much as possible. The parks I'm visiting are as follows: Grand Teton, Yellowstone, Glacier, North Cascades, Mt. Rainier, Olympic, Crater Lake. I only have 1-2 days in each park, but if anyone has any input about any of them I would love to hear it! Thanks!",Looking for input on NPS Road Trip
