VanLife,"Hello, sorry if this is not the right channel to ask this in, i seldom use reddit.

Anyway, i'm moving to utah this summer and will be living out of my van for at least 6 months, so I gotta keep allllll my climbing gear in there with me. I heard storing climbing gear in cars was not suggested due to some kind of fume from the car that may eat away at the nylon on my ropes/harness? Also concerned about the scorching temperature in my car having adverse effects on my gear. Anyone got experience with this? Would storing my ropes and harnesses in duffle bags or some type of container to block fumes/sunlight help at all? Do I have to worry about my metal gear too or is it just the soft stuff that gets affected? I'm kinda clueless about this subject so any help or links to online resources would be mega helpful. Thanks!",Storing climbing gear while living in van?

I am inviting everyone who lives a van-life or tried doing it, I would give you some questions about it (for example, the simple one is: what kind of events led you to this decision? Or: have you tried to prepare for it spiritually? and etc.) and it would be your decision which ones to answer and share your knowledge with the World! It's a free-format interview so we can have a call, you can record your voice talking or just messaging me (although more live interaction is more beneficial :)). You can add whatever you want to our conversation. I would be very thankful for your contribution!

VanLife,"In a few months I'm going to be purchasing my first cargo van, and I'll be off with it right away, since I have my backpacking gear and will have moved out of my current rental house.  I will be able to take my time and build up the interior as I go, but I'm wondering where you might think I'd be able to use my circular saw, sander, and router w/o disturbing anyone.  I envision using a generator on BLM, but I don't want to have to buy an extra beefy one for power tools.

The bus is powered by its original 70-hp, air-cooled engine, which means I can't run the engine while parked for more than a few minutes without burning it out. I was considering how to use the A/C existing system that will be installed within the next few weeks. I know that electric compressors are available and that they could be used instead of a mechanical compressor. This would allow me to run it off of the alternator while driving and off of the solar while parked. Has anyone else done this? If so, any suggestions or pro-tips?

I have a few questions I'm hoping someone can help me with:

So, I'm planning to use the profit of my house sale to fund some/all of my van build. My understanding regarding real estate taxes are concerned is that if I were to invest the money from my house sale into another brick and mortar/stationary/typical house I wouldn't need to pay taxes on that money (as long as the new house is my primary residence.) Assuming that's correct (and maybe its not?) does the same apply to the purchase of a house on wheels - if it intended to be my full-time/primary home? Something tells me the man won't see it that way, but is there an accountant (or anyone) out there who knows anything about this, can give me a little guidance? (I was planning to use a friend's house as my mailing address, but I'm guessing I'm going to need to establish a permanent residence with my home on wheels, somehow? Yikes.

Also, regarding financing for van builds. The money from my home sale may not be available in time to start the van build - trying to avoid too much time between the sale of me house and the completion of my van. If I don't have the cash to pay for everything, and I need to secure financing is there anyone who gave give me some pointers and/or recommendations on how to find a lender who would be willing to get creative with the financing? (For example, could I maybe finance the vehicle as a regular car loan separate from the build, and get a personal loan or something to pay for the build (maybe using my house as collateral?) and then merge them together in a single class B motorhome loan once the van is complete?)

VanLife,"So, I (25F) have been considering van life for a little while now, for a bunch of reasons: I love traveling, I am allergic to monotony, staying in one place long term stresses me out, financials, etc). I can easily live with a small amount of belongings, and I live for adventure. 

That being said, as of right now, I have an ‚Äò08 Subaru Legacy with a lot of miles on it. The backseats fold down, but it‚Äôs a small car. Plus, I often worry of breakdowns and expensive repairs. I have AAA, but driving a car with over 200k miles is still pretty risky. It had a lot of issues when I bought it, which I‚Äôve since fixed, but it‚Äôs still worrisome. 

So, that brings me to my main question. I‚Äôve been going back and forth between purchasing a cargo van (such as a Ford Econoline or Chevy Express) or a slightly newer Subaru Outback. I don‚Äôt have a terribly large budget (I‚Äôm looking in the $4,000-$10,000 range), and I plan on calling this vehicle my home, so I‚Äôd need to build it up a bit. I know vans can have sub-par gas milage, and their size is a bit intimidating. Obviously, the amount of space puts them at an advantage over SUVs, but I‚Äôm not totally sure of the long-run cost. 

Some things to keep in mind:
1. I am only 5‚Äô2, so putting a bed sideways will help with space
2. It‚Äôs just me, no significant other
3. I can get carsick when driving certain vehicles, but I‚Äôve personally never driven either type of car
4. I plan on storing my laptop and camera, so security and temperature are things on my mind
5. I‚Äôm not used to driving large vehicles (I once tried to drive a Dodge Grand Caravan on a highway and it was a nightmare), but I‚Äôve driven a UHaul and it was only mildly terrifying. It might just be something to get used to?
6. I plan on chasing warmer weather, so I don‚Äôt anticipate any freezing nights. Of course, they can happen, so obviously I‚Äôd have to be prepared.
7. As of right now, I‚Äôm figuring out plans for making money. I have a good video camera and equipment, so I might try my hand at youtube, but obviously I can‚Äôt rely on that, so any ideas would be appreciated. I have a Bachelors Degree in Creative Writing and I currently work with Doordash and as a restaurant hostess. 

I‚Äôd LOVE to get some insight and advice. I‚Äôve been researching heavily, but nothing is as good as personal comments directed to my specific situation. I recently moved back in with my mom and sister in New Jersey and I am super ready to get out within this year. I need to wake up by some mountains.

Tl;dr: I want to live in a vehicle, but not sure if I should spring for a big cargo van (which might be hard to drive/not as good gas milage/etc) or an SUV (less space, but easier).",Cargo Van or SUV?

VanLife,"I am very interested in living full time in a van, possibly a camper, possibly a converted transit. However due to my dyspraxia, I have always driven only automatic cars and have an auto only license. Even if I had a manual license I would much prefer to drive auto only. 

Obviously living in the UK, there are a lot more manual vans available, and auto vans are often a fair bit more expensive. 

My question is...does anyone have any idea of what the cost might be to have a manual van converted to be a completely automatic transmission? Including the gear box, auto stick and the conversion to only two pedals. 

It might make it easier to choose a great van with the much larger selection if this is financially viable. 

My budget is about ¬£8000. This would include buying the van and converting the transmission. Or else I will just need to spent the ¬£8000 outright on an automatic van.

My SO and I recently got a '96 Dodge Ram Van we're super excited to start working on.

One thing I noticed with many of these converted vans is that people use wood for the interior: flooring, wall paneling, ceiling, etc.

I wanted to know if this was for a specific purpose aside aesthetics. So much wood can be heavy for the van, so we were looking into alternatives unless there were specific reasons to use wood.

VanLife,"I'm currently converting my 2011 VW Caddy into a micro-camper, and am looking for advice on ventilation, if anyone can give any?

Ideally I want a small, low profile vent on the roof that I can open/ close to control the airflow and let in some light. I'm not trying to stealth camp really, but I'd feel a lot better about having a vent on the roof that I could leave open at night, rather than the windows that someone could pretty easily notice are open.

I'm not sure about paying upwards of ¬£70 for something that may not be necessary, though, especially since the van is so small - most of the roof vents seem like overkill in a tiny van.

I was wondering if there's something similar to a mushroom vent that I could install, but which I could open/ close, since I don't want a constant outlet to the cold air outside (I'm in the UK, so it's cold more often than not). I recognise that wouldn't let in any light, but that's not a huge deal breaker.

Alternately, I guess I could try fitting a louvre vent on the side of the van and hooking up a small fan to help with air intake/ extraction, but I'm nervous about cutting holes in the van as it is. I feel like it'll be easier to hide any mistakes on the top of the van, rather than right there on the side!

I'm not sure of the best way to do this, so if anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation, I'd be really glad of the advice - thanks!",Ventilation in micro-camper?

I'm Italian (Italian passport), I've been living and working in London for 7 years, I now got the ""Settled"" status from the EU settlement scheme for Europeans in the UK, so I can continue living and working in the UK, but I can also stay in Europe if I wanted (I don't lose my ""Settled"" status in the UK as long as I come back to the UK within 5 years).I have an Italian driving license, I use it only in Italy (I stay 2 months a year in Italy)

My boss told me that I don't need to go to the office anymore (I'm a web developer), so I'm planning to buy a second-hand camper-van and work from my laptop while traveling through the UK and Europe.

**If I buy a second-hand camper-van in the UK** (let's say, for example, a converted Ford Transit) make sure MOT is ok, it's serviced, it's registered as a motor caravan, and insurance covers European countries, **can I potentially stay only in Europe** (for example Germany, Italy, etc, when quarantine travel rules will allow) and **come back to the UK just for renewing the MOT** (that expires every 12 months)?

I am asking because I don't know if it's better for me to buy the camper-van in the UK or in Italy, considering that I don't know in advance if I'll stay more in the UK or in Europe.

I have been very interested in a mobile lifestyle for a few years now.  I have a 1986 Chevrolet C10 Silverado Longbed that I plan on building a stealth camper in.  I am an expert woodworker, amateur welder, and Industrial Designer so I have no concerns about the build. 

HOWEVER I am concerned about the actual lifestyle.  I am not exactly the most social; not a loner but some social anxiety.  Therefore I am quite worried that when I attempt to live mobile that I will end up feeling isolated.  

Additionally, I am worried about wasting the opportunity.  I foresee an unfortunate potential future where the sum total of my mobile living experience is just visiting Walmart parking lots across the country.

VanLife,"So I was going to build something else but decided a bus would be better and look far more attractive as well. They are both 35' buses but I cannot decide between the flat nose and the dog nose. For this instance I am leaning towards the dog nose because it is in better shape and the groundwork is already laid for my conversion. They are both the same price.

**Uses For Build:**  
So this is going to be a full time living thing. At the end of the month my lease is up and I want to at least have this be sleep-able within about 10 days which is doable on either build but the dog nose will be faster. I also want this to be a 100% boondocking rig that can operate off grid. I can park this rig at work during the work week as well but cannot connect to shore power.

Do you have anything to add here or any comments? I am leaning one way but I want to make sure I make the best decision.

# Dog nose FE:

**Pros:**

* Interior is already stripped with interior paint and flooring done
* Exterior is also primed and ready for me to paint it.
* I will have the ability to maintain the vehicle myself by just popping the hood.
* Ability to build garage in the back since it has that big door
* Easy to hear how the engine is running

**Cons:**

* Less interior space at the same overall length
* Can't hide that is used to be a bus for RV parks although I have no interest in RV parks
* Less traction in snow although this may not be an issue after I build out my water tanks in the back

&amp;#x200B;

# Flat Nose RE:

**Pros:**

* More interior space
* More traction
* Less noise when driving
* Could blend more at RV parks even though I don't want to go to RV parks

**Cons:**

* Hard to hear how the engine is running
* Cannot build garage
* Super low to the ground
* Has airbag suspension (less reliable than leaf springs)
* It is a bus inside so I will need to scrap everything and then do all the pain and flooring

I‚Äôm going to start my van build in April, and I‚Äôm planning what I‚Äôll need to buy, but I‚Äôm very confused about power and certain electric appliances.

I‚Äôm thinking of getting a Jackery 500, which can output 500w. Most water kettles I‚Äôve seen draw around 1500 watts, and most induction cooktops are over 1000w as well.

Do I understand correctly that a Jackery 500 won‚Äôt be able to power these?

Do you know of any appliances like water kettles or induction cooktops that will definitely work with it?

The main thing I need to know is: can I boil water with just 500 watts, and how can I do it? I would prefer not to use a butane stove in the van, if possible (just because the canisters are so wasteful).

VanLife,"Howdy folks. 

Just wondering if anyone has experience converting a transit crew cab (1 row of seats) into a camper build. I am getting ready to pull the trigger and order an AWD high roof extended, but I am getting hung up on spending the few extra grand for the second row of seats.

I want the second row for friends and further down the line when I may have a kid I want to bring along. Having airbags and seat mounts from the factory seem like a no brainer for this. However I have a couple concerns:

1. Insulation. I live on northern alberta and mostly use my current van for skiing. Lots of time will be spent in -10C and all the way down to -35C is nothing out of the ordinary. Because of the airbags 1/2 finished interior on the floor, walls, and roof I dont think it would be practical to install any insulation in the front section. 

Does anyone have experience insulating only the rear half of their van? Did you get uncomfortable at a certain point? Would prefer not to have to run the heater at all times because of thermal losses 

2. Does anyone have experience with retrofitting a different seat? The stock seat looks like it would make getting into the back with the doors closed a major PITA. I saw that you can get a shorter 36""/37"" seat from the passenger models that will fit in that spot, but that is ANOTHER 500 bucks if I can even find one used. Has anyone done this?

3. Would you trust an aftermarket seat install with the life of your child (lol)? I have been getting mixed reviews about adding a seat later and how safe this option really is. It would be a nice solution to my problem though to just get the cargo model and install a single seat where it fits best when the time comes and I actually NEED it.

VanLife,,"Finished my van build for under 200$, well it has a kitchen, a bed and plenty of space."
VanLife,"Hey,

So yeah long story short, started in a hatchback a long time ago..  Upgraded to a van last year but I'm thinking about going back down to a car.  Here's my thoughts:

Because I work for GM, I can get a new vehicle at staff price.  A base model Chevy spark is $11,700 for a manual transmission.  Staff price would be discounted off that so I could probably still  get a 2020 for like ten grand.  

I really, *really* love this car.  I've driven them around and they're fun.  Not a lot of power, it's basically a golf cart but I don't care.  The reason why I love it is because it's low tech; manual windows, manual door locks, manual mirrors.  It has cruise control, a small infotainment system with the mandatory back up camera and that's it.  No fancy electronics to fail outside of warranty.

Compare that with my 2007 van.  It's only 13 years old but already lots of problems.  Power door locks have failed, had to fix that.  Power window failed, had to fix that as well.  Coolant leaks.  Gasket leaks.  Yes I get staff price on parts because I work for them but still....it sucks.  The maintenance is getting to me.

So heres the obvious pros and cons.

The van has way more space of course.  I built a bed in the back and it fits behind where the seat was (I took out the passenger seat).  I can almost stand up inside.  So yeah,  roomy.

HOWEVER

The cons are this: Gas mileage suuuuucks. When I had my little car I was getting 40 mpg on the highway.  I could fill it up for $25 and drive for two weeks.  The van loves the juice !  With one of these new cars, I can still get 38 mpg highway with the 5 speed.  

PLUS

With a brand new car I get warranty.  If anything shits the bed it'll most likely be covered.  And like I said I work for GM so I can get cheaper parts cost.

Now the obvious con against the car:

The lack of space.  I'd already be pulling out all of the seats (spare me the comments about tearing apart a brand new car) and would need to build the sleeping area where the existing passenger seat is.  I'd need to build windows coverings to seal up the front against looky-loos peering inside my car while I'm sleeping.  I'd barely have enough space behind the driver's seat for a little shelf for clothing etc.

But even with the massive lack of space, when I had my car I just felt more..

Free?  It *felt better*.  I actually miss my little car.  I miss paying &lt;$30 for a tank of gas.  Other things like stealth, food &amp; climate don't really bother me; I work a second job in a restaurant nights/weekends &amp; I eat for free every morning at a local church.  My food costs are nearly zero.  I basically only use my van for sleeping and storage anyway.  I live in a climate where it doesn't get too cold in winter so I don't need to worry about snow or freezing to death.   Heating a smaller space is actually easier than trying to heat a huge van.

ALSO

Insurance would be negligible.  By law here you'd have to have full comprehensive IF you finance;. However because I'd just pay it in full (it's only $10k) I don't need full insurance because I'm not in debt to a creditor.  I'd only get basic and maybe fire, theft &amp; windows.  My current van insurance is only $634/year and my car was only $1/month more than the van!

I'm just so torn on this.  Yeah I like the added space but I've also noticed I'm starting to collect more shit because I have the space.  I cleaned out the van today and I was like ""where the F did all this come from?"". I consider myself a minimalist; I've lived out of a backpack for years and have traveled the world on next to nothing.  Like I said, because I won't be cooking in the vehicle, I just need a spot to lay my head and store some clothes. I do everything else that all of us vanlifers do: gym for showers, I also do have a storage unit $49/month for keepsakes, mementos, some stuff I really don't use often like twice a year etc.  So if I do need anything I can just grab it from my unit.

VanLife,"Feel like im going crazy. im typically pretty good at googling but even though there is a wealth of van articles and websites, i can not find one that charts how much power people are producing daily over say a month or so period with their solar panel arrays. There is a million detailing how to calculate your power needs. What I am looking for is just a chart showing how many amp hours are produced daily on average with a say 500 watt solar panel array. Maybe in various conditions (ie. winter vs summer). Feel like it impossible to make actual solar panel decisions based on how much you use and then getting the appropriate battery/solar to match. For example if I live in the PNW, I might go for a propane burner over an induction if filling the battery bank is not feasible through solar.  Obviously people charge through various methods in addition to their solar arrays but feel like it would be really helpful to know (around) how much i can expect to produce with solar (if that info is out there)",Chart of Amp hours actually produced by various solar panel set ups

I still have a fair ways to go and thought I would ask some questions here, for my benefit as well as for any others who would have the same questions.

I'll be doing my best to fill out the answers to these questions myself as I continue to learn, so if there's a question on this post that hasn't been answered that you'd like to know the answer to, save the post and check back periodically, as I'll be updating.

I'll post some great resources I've found too, at the end of the post.

Some of these questions are pretty simple and I'll report back soon with what I can dig up!

Questions - 

1. In terms of a solar panel setup, is it critical to buy a panel that has a lower VoC rating than the voltage that a solar charge controller is rated for? For example, if I have a 300w solar panel, that has a VoC of, say, 40V, would you then *need* a solar charge controller with a voltage rating of 50 or higher? I'm assuming yes, but I thought, why not ask. 

2. Is it possible to charge a nominal 12v battery with a 24v solar panel? If yes, is it the charge controller that's allowing this?

3. What does everybody recommend for wiring both your battery bank and panel array in regards to series vs. parallel? 

    I understand that, when an array is wired in parallel, partial shading becomes slightly less of an issue (it's a big issue for series connections), and that parallel isn't good for when you have a decently long run from your panels to your batteries, because of the resistance within long wires. I would be inclined to wire my panels in parallel, as I don't have a long run, and the effects of partial shading is reduced, but would you not also gain more charge to your batteries because of the increased current? 

4. This question kind of relates to the last one, about series vs. parallel.

    Would a series connection charge the battery for more time out of the day, due to more volts being squeezed out of the sun, due to the series connection? (Series -&gt; double voltage)

    Here's how I understand it (probably wrongly), In order to reverse the chemical reactions in the battery and get it to charge, you must supply a voltage that's greater (but not too much greater!) than the nominal voltage rating of the battery, usually 12v. And from what I understand, the supplied voltage can't dip below the nominal value, the battery won't charge on any lesser voltage. So would it stand to reason that an array wired in series could supply more voltage for longer, therefore charging the battery more? 

    The answer to this one seems pretty elusive, as some people have their panels wired in parallel, and others in series. Which I guess makes it somewhat of a preference. I just, like, don't know, man.

5. In regards to wire sizes, what would be stopping someone, besides the cost, from using huge diameter wires for everything? Would this be dangerous in some way?

6. This ones pretty dumb, but the charge controller is what handles the charge profile of the battery, right? And how would a BMS interact with a solar charge controller? I should be able to find this one on my own.

7. I've heard that certain types of new lithium battery tech can allow for a connection between batteries of different sizes and ages. Is this true? 

8. Another easy one: Fuse sizing. How do? Should be pretty simple.

VanLife,"Howdy. I currently own a 1994 Mitsubishi delica that I mainly use for skiing. As such I am sleeping in ski resort parking lots all the time and st trail heads/road side turn offs at backcountry ski zones. 

Ive decided I want a high roof van so I can stand up and be more comfortable for extended trips and maybe even live in for an anticipated move coming up. 

Does anyone have experience with rwd cargo vans in AB and BC winters? I routinely use the 4x4 in my deljca to get out of parking lots, but I've never tried to make it work with only 2wd even though though how I use the van 95% of regular driving. I've pretty much narrowed it down to a frod transit awd but since they still only came out in 2020 I'll likely have to order a new one to get a spec I want. 55 grand for a High roof awd is just a lot of money and id like to avoid it if possible.",Need AWD/4x4 advice from fellow Canadians.
VanLife,"I have the ball rolling to trade my car in for a 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan ($15k CAD, 64k km), which I intend to make into a camper. My immediate motivation for this is that I live on an island (ferry access to mainland), and I want to be able to drive over to the mainland during the week for work, and not have to pay for a hotel. I would also love to be able to go camping, and to drive further across the country for adventure and more work options (I work in the film industry).

Minivan is easier to get used to driving, coming from a car. It's cheap to maintain and repair, and has good fuel economy.

But I have a dream of moving out of my shared apartment and living in a van full time, and I don't know if I'll regret not getting a larger vehicle now. If I got a cargo van or a sprinter, for that price, I would have to get something older with more km. And it would have worse fuel economy and be more expensive to maintain and repair.

I already live pretty minimally, but I don't think I could make the Caravan work for me for full time living, mostly because I have two guitars (acoustic and electric).

So I think my options are:

1. Buy the Caravan, keep renting my apartment bedroom, use van for mainland work and camping. Don't make permanent changes to the van, so I can sell it if I decide to upgrade. (and if I end up living in it, I could always sell my guitars and get a small traveller acoustic/electric combo)
2. Buy an older cargo van now, and eat the initial additional cost of fuel (and possibly high maintenance and repair bills right out the gate), to get more space and have a viable live-in situation right off the bat.

Any additional perspective on this beyond my own would be really helpful. Thanks in advance &lt;3","About to get a Grand Caravan, but I'm torn. Looking for advice."
VanLife,"Hi,

My bf and me have been researching van conversions for the last weeks but after doing some maths and having some concerns we are not really sure this is for us and I would like your opinion.

1. New or used van? Ideally we wanted a new van, but then our final costs would equals about 600 nights of midrange hotels &gt;_&lt; 

2. We wanted to use the van for long periods of time and work remotely from there but of course we dont want to pay campings on top of the 600 nights of hotels :) Although in Europe this is becoming tougher and they are forbidding people to sleep in their vehicles (ex: Portugal). Anyways, do you have any experience working remotely from your van especially in Europe? It is possible to do it somehow comfortably? Any tips?

VanLife,"I am considering buying myself a travel trailer to live in full time. I already have a vehicle that should be able to tow, so that is why I don't want to go in the direction of a van, and I don't need the stealthiness a van provides either.

I was hoping to find some ""TrailerLife"" folks, but /r/VanLife was the closest I found.

The vehicle I would be towing with is a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk with tow package. The manufacture says this allows me 4,500 lbs of tow capacity. Without the tow package the Cherokee normally tows 2,000 lbs. I am curious, what actually offers the extra 2,500 lbs of capacity, and should I give myself breathing room between the GVW of the trailer and the towing capacity?

I was looking at getting something like the TAB 400 Solo, a teardrop trailer, which has a ""Total Gross Weight (Dry)"" of 2,876 lbs, and a ""GAWR"" of 3,900 lbs (is this the same or similar to GVWR?) Since these numbers are below the 4,500 lb tow capacity of my vehicle, this means my vehicle should be fine towing this trailer, correct?

Another thing I was looking at was the price of the TAB 400 Solo is a bit up there, and I just want to make sure I know what I am getting for my money.

I saw a regular trailer ([https://coachmenrv.com/travel-trailers/apex-nano](https://coachmenrv.com/travel-trailers/apex-nano)), for almost half the price, with similar weight, but more volume inside the trailer. Larger bathroom, etc. However, the TAB 400 Solo, looks like it comes a bit more feature packed with solar panels and such.

It's a bit overwhelming looking at this stuff since I am not super familiar with trailers, so hoping to meet people who could share some of their experience. Especially on safety regarding towing with my vehicle, and on what I should look out for when buying a trailer.

VanLife,"I'm still planning my build, and I wanted to ask around if anyone has thoughts about an idea I'm toying with. While I'm sure that everyone knows Dometic, ARB, etc. make excellent fridges, it's also beyond doubt that they are expensive. Apart from their price they also share another quality, efficiency, as compared to mini-fridges and the like which bleed the sinking cold air like mad when the door is opened. Chest-style fridges like Dometic don't have this problem because they retain the cold air inside their body, thus requiring less electricity for cooling. So what about using a chest freezer?

A 3.5 cubic foot chest freezer is less than $200, extremely well insulated, and when coupled with a cheap inverter and an in-line thermostat it could be the ultimate combination of low-cost and high-efficiency. In my case, I already own a dedicated inverter for the project as well as an Inkbird thermostat to adjust from freezing to regular refrigeration temperatures. I'd be putting this setup in a 2002 Ford E-250, so space is somewhat limited of course--but I think I could pull it off. Barring anything I haven't thought of, it should cost around $200.

VanLife,"Hi Everyone, 

I‚Äôve been building my van for two months. I bought it on December 5th. Am using the FarOutRide layout for a high powered system, and I have a domestic brisk 2 on the roof. I have an older Cobra 3000 watt peak modified sine wave inverter which obviously doesn‚Äôt cut it, in spite of a soft smart capacitor.

Yesterday I installed a Victron Multiplus 3000 watt inverter/charger (which is AWESOME), however my house batteries drained very quickly. They are two new big Duracell deep cell batteries for RVs, and when I woke up this morning the house batteries were almost dead. I wired it with 2 awg stranded wire to the bus bars and one A/C output to a triple plug, which measures 120ac on all three plugs. 

Additionally, when I ran a second AC output to the 20amp AC breaker for the domestic brisk, it read 87 volts with the breaker off and with the breaker on only mV on both sides. So I took that out and wired a grounded plug and plugged it in to the triple plug, and it did run the fan on the air conditioner, and it ran the cold ac, but indicated the house battery was low and then quickly became too low. Before this my house batteries have never gone below 60%. 

What‚Äôs even more confusing is the house batteries did not charge while I left the vehicle running for a couple hours, and the 12v charging solenoid has never been a problem previously.

The long and the short of it is when I installed the Victron Inverter Charger my house batteries went dead. The only potential cause I can identify is I did not ground the Victron box itself. The inverter was also flat on its back instead of mounted upright. There are no loose grounds of which I‚Äôm aware.

Of note - I had left the headlights on the night before and used my 120v AC battery charger and quick start to get the truck running. Three quick starts and 15 minutes of charging (while plugged into the house batteries) got the van started.

VanLife,"Hi all,

I'm considering purchasing a Ford Transit with a diesel engine that has 150K miles on it. A mechanic friend suggested that the mileage was high and that diesel engines are harder to get work done on.

Two questions:

1. My research suggests that 150K miles for a diesel engine is really not that high if the engine has been well taken care of; anyone have experience that they can share on this front?
2. Is it difficult to find someone to do work? I've seen most people suggest that a positive of the Ford is that the work can be done at the dealership and there's a ton of them out there, but I haven't been able to find anything on whether most dealerships can handle diesel engine work

Is there anything I'm missing on diesel? In general, the research I've seen suggests that diesel can be a great route to go because the engines can last a lot longer.

Just bought this van a few weeks ago. Battery tested a little low on purchase date but started every time. After the mechanic's inspection I figured it would be a simple battery replacement for easy start ups every time but it has still had difficulty turning over. Engine never died on me while on road. Its been very mild where I live in the sf bay area

I've been eager to wrench on it and have removed the center dash radio/console (along with unplugging the 5 wires that were attached to it) the plastic vent, and removed the doghouse. Also removed the front passenger seat and vaccumed.

I've rolled it in neutral onto the driveway, put it in park and engaged the parking brake. Steering is locked. There was an odd ticking noise that came from somewhere under the dash area but it stopped when I pressed on the brakes

Electronic locks/interior lights are inconsistent. They work one minute and then fail the next. Cant get dash lights to turn on, no crank or any sounds when turning key to ignition. Im thinking the wiring may be fried somewhere..? Not sure which wires would be at fault

Hello,

I know this is a stretch as nothing is yet defined, but in terms of car, model, sizes, lifestyle, maintenance, investment..I've 3 vehicles under my radar, and they are available around me.

LT28: found one for 6000‚Ç¨, renovated in welding, insulation, and flooring, with solar panel, kitchen, water tank, gas tank..

T3: did not find one yet, but I like it's more compact than the LT28 but with high roof I could still stand in it

L400: very cheap, totally empty inside, I could spend the remaining money in making it mine, but I'll end up having something where I can barely fit myself + dog and I can never stand up.

&amp;#x200B;

I will travel..sometimes for a weekend, but one day for 6/12 months. It will be me, my dog, maybe a partner, and that's it. Of course would be nice to go on weekends with friends, but it will happen 1/2 a year. I‚Äôd surely like to have a car that I can use for the next 5+ years (unless I want to sell it for something else) and travel from weekend trips to long far away journeys in the middle of nowhere :)

  
I love the LT28 just because it's big, its a classic, very easy to resell, quite cheap for what I'll get I think, it allows me to create a house inside..  
I'm just afraid it's too big, too heavy, lots of consumption, constant work in progress..

The T3 with high top I think is the great sized camper, but I do not find many and the ones I can afford are the same price of the LT28...not sure if in being compact it's a good investment or not?! Considering the LT28 and the L400 I feel the T3 has best and worst of both worlds, and doesn‚Äôt really leaves you with a strong reason on choosing this but maybe I don‚Äôt see it right!? 

The L400 I love that is 4x4 and that is so compact - nobody would know you're sleeping in there - and that it's newer, more reliable, cheaper, faster...it's closer to a proper car rather than a old heavy van. Also can be put in a garage for safety while the other two are too big for standard garages. And this I think it‚Äôs easier/cheaper to load on boats.

&amp;#x200B;

This is really the super summary of what I think in terms of pros and cons, but I'd LOVE if I could hear your opinions. I want to choose by the end of this week as I've different cars lined up but I want to organize meetings with the ones I really think is right to go for..and I know it depends by the state of the car, but I also want to push and look out for my type of vehicle.

VanLife,"  

This is my first time working with electric, off grid, solar, everything ‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at (and humbly looking for guidance).

Just bought a ‚Äô95 Chevy G30 15-psgr van (used as a nursing home transport van), with a hightop and only 60,000 original miles. Converting to a DIY budget campervan, but we‚Äôre only planning on using it for vacations: maybe one weekend/month, and two 2-3 week trips each year, so like 50-60 days per year. When we are on these trips, we will probably be driving an average of 2-3 hours/day. We are NOT living in it, so we are only looking to install a minimal to moderate solar system that can power:

2 laptops, 1 iPad, 2 cell phones, 1 hot spot, 1 cellular booster, LED lights, MaxxFan Deluxe ‚Ä¶ AND

110V Freezer Chest!

I know that there is a lot of debate about the pros/cons of doing a freezer chest conversion vs. 12V DC fridge. When we go camping, we drink a lot of adult beverages . . . we‚Äôre on vacation. This seems like to cheapest way to get a big fridge that will keep those drinks cold. And it sounds like the power usage can be comparable or less than a 12V fridge, as long as I don‚Äôt have the inverter running 24/7. 

The system I have designed is basically built from the starting point of getting this freezer and figuring out how to power it without keeping an inverter on all day.

[https://www.homedepot.com/p/Koolatron-Kool-3-5-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-KTCF99/301097784](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Koolatron-Kool-3-5-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-KTCF99/301097784)

[https://www.koolatron.com/CA/en/white-chest-freezer-99l](https://www.koolatron.com/CA/en/white-chest-freezer-99l)

Importantly, this particular freezer has a thermostat that can go up to 32 degrees, so we‚Äôre thinking that drinks and any non-produce food can stay cold, without freezing too much. If that doesn‚Äôt work, and it is too cold, we will try and manually alter the thermostat like the home brewers suggest:

[https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/guide-to-set-internal-chest-freezer-thermostat-to-32f-eliminate-external-control.249612/](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/guide-to-set-internal-chest-freezer-thermostat-to-32f-eliminate-external-control.249612/)

If either of these methods work, I would not need an external thermostat to regulate the freezer temp: it will either be factory set at 32, or I will manually adjust that upwards, closer to 40. 

Because the fridge will be plugged into an inverter all day, I looked for an inverter with a Power Save mode, so that it will only turn on when there is a draw. GoPower inverters have that option:

‚ÄúPower saving mode enables the inverter to turn itself on and off looking for a specific sized load, yet draw less power than standard operation. When power saving is enabled and the inverter senses a load, it may take one second for the load to become active. This one-second wait will be fine for loads that draw continually, such as televisions and stereos. However, it may not be suitable for loads that are intermittent such as bread makers, power tools or blenders. Power saving will continually draw a small amount of power from the batteries, so if the inverter will not be in use for longer than a day, it is advisable to turn the inverter off using the on/off switch located on the front of the inverter or remote.‚Äù

[https://gpelectric.com/products/1500-watt-industrial-pure-sine-wave-inverter/](https://gpelectric.com/products/1500-watt-industrial-pure-sine-wave-inverter/)

[https://gpelectric.com/products/gp-sw1500-ts/](https://gpelectric.com/products/gp-sw1500-ts/)

My hope is that when the fridge thermostat goes to turn the compressor on, it will wake the inverter up to provide power. This should only happen a couple of times an hour, and should only run for a few minutes each time. 

Another option, would be to follow this poster‚Äôs advice, he used a few more components to be able to basically do the same thing‚Äîautomatically turn the inverter on, only when the thermostat turns on:

So, with the freezer chest conversion as my starting point, I need an inverter that will only turn on when the compressor turns on. After that, I am just trying to install the most cost-effective and efficient components for the rest of my system. I thought we could try to get by with 200W solar and 100Ah lithium. But, I want to make sure that my components can support an expansion to 400W solar and 200Ah, if it turns out that we need more power. Here is where I am at:

VanLife,"I've been following vanlife stuff for a while, thinking about some sort of sprinter post retirement for myself.  That is my main goal in the subreddit.  I'm kind of on hold with that while prices are ridic.

But we have a family situation.  My mother in law has had a rough life.  Lots of addiction, poor health as a result, awful finances as a result.  We have been housing her temporarily in a family home but as probate comes to a close we cannot afford to hold it and let her stay completely free anymore.  She lives 700 miles from us and refuses to move closer. We have a few months to figure something out for her.  The estate also has an older motorhome- 1977.  She expressed interest in it but I took a closer look and it is totally hammered.  Mice, no plumbing, missing siding etc.  It isn't a project she is capable of taking on.  And from a distance it isn't a project I can take on.

&amp;#x200B;

Wife mentioned buying her a better motorhome to live in $5,000-10,000 price range.  We would title it to her.  She gets enough alimony, social security and public assistance to insure it and probably pay to park it most of the time.  We are financially stable.  Maybe more than stable.  But MIL is capable of consuming infinite time and resources.  We want to help her with a living situation without being a bottomless handout.  We offered her a semi-permanent apartment that we own in our home town- and a job- but she will not move- or work.    

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a horrible idea?  How expensive is FT RV life in a 1990's era modest size unit?  can she scrape by on $600 a month if insurance is covered?

&amp;#x200B;

additional details:

She lives in the southwest, warm, dry desert climate.

She can drive and has owned a car pretty continuously.

She has enough family and 'friends' that she can probably bounce driveway to driveway 75% of the time.  She also has some family land out in the desert she can fall back on frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns:

She isn't the greatest driver and a motorhome is hard to drive.

VanLife,"  I‚Äôm currently a junior in college. I‚Äôve been browsing the Van Life sub and watching videos for a few months now and I‚Äôve decided that I want to try the van lifestyle. I guess my main concern is how exactly to get started? 

   I‚Äôm looking for something economical, I don‚Äôt exactly have the money to drop 20k on a van conversion and I feel like all the bells and whistles goes against what van life is supposed to be about anyway. I‚Äôve currently got about 3,000 saved up and hope to purchase my van sometime in the next few months. Something in the range of 4,000 or less for the van and 1,000 for the conversion would be ideal. 

   Age of model isn‚Äôt an issue but I‚Äôd prefer something recent enough that I won‚Äôt have a hard time trying to find parts to fix it if necessary. I‚Äôm not interested in the ginormous cargo or delivery truck type vans, I prefer something compact but still large enough to not be suffocating. I‚Äôm pretty short at 5‚Äô6 and I‚Äôd like to be able to stand up in my van, so I wonder whether or not a high top is necessary? In regards to the actual conversion I know heat and insulation are something I need, but I‚Äôd like to know what is a requirement for survival and what I can possible do without, ie a generator vs a solar panel, a hot plate vs a kitchen etc.

   In summary, I guess I‚Äôm wondering what would be the most economical van to buy and convert, with only the basic essentials for survival and relative comfort on the road, without being too large or extravagant. Also I‚Äôd prefer something with some color as opposed to the standard plain white van but that‚Äôs a minor issue in the grand scheme of things. There‚Äôs no rush, as I‚Äôm not planning on starting my trip till I graduate so I have time to slowly convert it these next few years. If anyone has any suggestions or advice I‚Äôd really appreciate it.","Interested in van life, unsure on how to get started?"

It's listed on google maps, there's a couple sparse entries about it if you search for it. There's no campground listed there on the forest service website (though maybe it'd be on another federal website?). There's two reviews on the google listing and they're fairly recent, saying it's an awesome spot, but that's about all there is. It looks like an incredible location. It shows up on google earth satellite and you can see a little path leading to what looks like could be a campground? This is the place on google earth.

VanLife,"Hi there!

I feel like my current life has too many limitations. I'm not able to sleep whenever I want, I'm not able to rest whenever I want, I'm not able to make music when I want, I'm not able to work whenever I want etc. Therefore, I'm leaving my house and want to live on the streets. (40 hours work every week, is not worth the comfort of owning a house). I want to make money by playing music on the streets. (10/20 euro a day would be enough for me haha).

I've build an electric mountainboard which runs on 36v, 800w. I want to attach a (2 meter x 1.4 meter, carbon fiber) trailer to it.

I want to run the mountainboard on 3 car batteries in series.

Since you can't discharge and charge batteries at the same time with solar (right?), I was thinking of getting 6 car batteries in total. This way I can charge 3 batteries (with solar panels) while I discharge the other 3 (while cruising).

A single car battery is 12v and 42ah (and only 25 euro, new, a piece).

I want to keep things as cheap as possible, so 18650 batteries might not be not be an option.

I'm hoping someone here has the knowledge regarding solar panels and is able to help me with chasing my dream-life.

I'm aiming for 15h\~ solar charge time. (for charging 3x12v 42ah at the same time).

&amp;#x200B;

* What kind of (lightweight) solar panels (watt, volt) do I need for this? (I live in the Netherlands, not that sunny).
* Is it possible to charge 3 batteries at the same time in series (or parallel?). I'm only able to find information about 2 at the same time.
* What mppt/pwm would be sufficient?
* Any other (cheaper) options/ideas?
* Things I might overlook?

Your advice would mean the world to me.

VanLife,"Hi Vanlife! I love watching these crazy builds but don't have the bandwith to pull off something like that. Ive chosen a 'jack of all trades' approach with a 2010 acura MDX. Small enough to drive to work, softroads, has just over 6ft sleeping space, and eats up highway miles for our small trips.

I recently made a platform/seat replacement to get the back a little flatter, but am struggling with a matress solution. The thermarest slides all over, blanket mattress doesent smooth out the transitions, and the trifold cushion I got is not supportive enough and my wife and I roll off the sides.

Any tips on building a mattress cut perfectly to fit the space? Maybe a stiff foam on bottom with a softer one on top? What stiffness foam should I get? Where can I get it? Plywood on bottom? Can I cover it in fabric?

My work has a dodge promaster that is 6-7 years old that I drive occasionally and at just 30k miles I am flabbergasted at how poorly it has aged. 

I'm curious if there has been any comparative analysis on the pros/cons of each companies take on the large high-top van that would be ideal to renovate into a camper style van. I specifically ask this because I would probably be looking at getting a new or close to new van if I decided to make the dive. Obviously mercedes seems to be the answer if you have the money.

VanLife,"I've wanted to start living the van life for a few years now but to say the least I've just struggled to get my shit together and I haven't been able to get myself to buckle down and land a remote job that would allow me to do that. I'm 24 and literally have no other financial responsibilities other than my car as I am living with my parents. Scouting for possible freelance / remote work opportunities is not the main point of this post, but any input on that would also be welcome. Will probably even make a completely separate post about it...and now that I think about it I have no idea why I've never thought to pose that question on this sub.

Anyway back to my main question. Can anyone recommend some decent and affordable car insurance companies that have worked for them during their travels? My family and I have used Geico for a few years and of course they're great but I just tried to get a quote for a single person / vehicle and it was something like $200 per month. I believe this is largely in part because I've been in two minor accidents in the last five years and my driver's license has been suspended for over a year due to unpaid tickets. But I mean Geico is also one of the bigger and more established insurance companies, so similar to almost all other products and services that have big names and advertise on TV, I imagine there have to be some lesser known companies out there that offer as good or almost as good of coverage for less. 

In terms of what I would be looking for, roadside assistance really be the only thing I would want without question. Aside from that I'm not sure. Of course I also would like to not pay an arm and a leg if something were to happen to my vehicle while out on the road, but that's the case for everybody and why people get insurance in the first place.

Another relevant detail would be that I don't plan on constantly being out on the road month in and month out. My plan is to travel to different work-exchange programs / locations such as WWOOF, staying for 2-4 weeks at a time at each location.

VanLife,"Hey, my name is (forgot my redditname). Delete if not allowed but this has to be saod. Fair warning this is going to be a long post but I've been seeing a lot of miss information so I wanted to explain a normal life as a VanLifer. I no longer live in my Van because I never had Insulation so I saved to rent a place for the Winter then covid hit and I just kept to the house because I felt it was safer and I got a cat who helped me though loneness and depression. If you are a VanLifer Loneness and Depression are often part of the life, its sad but true. 

When I was living out my Van I didn't have all this fancy stuff. I keep seeing all these vans that been tricked out to have showers and toilets but if I'm being honest, if you can afford to spend 10k on a Van your better off getting a house or fixing your credit. Yes, the adventure part is fun but you know what else is fun? Not being in debt. All I had when I was in my Van was 8 pairs of cloths for the week that I put on more than once per week.  I smelled like shit sometimes but when that happened I just stayed in my Van away from people. When my clothes didnt read ""I'm Homeless!!!!"" I spent most of my time in coffee shops playing video games on my laptop and/or reading books while I charged my phone. I never had Internet in my van because the only way I got internet was using my phones hotspot and there's no way IN HELL I was going to waste that! Because if I got in a emergcy where I needed wifi on a weekend and the coffee shop is fully, or I couldnt afford a cup of coffee and would get kicked out I would feel stupid for wasting my hotspot on a game of Overwatch. Also I had to charge my phone in the coffee shop DURING THE DAY. My Van didnt charge when it was turned off so I would have to not use my phone during the day and use my laptop more so I would have charge for the next day so I can call work. I was thinking of buying a portable battery charger nut those cost MONEY. One of the most commonly asked question in the group is how we get money? I stayed in one city and had a full time job that paid shit! VanLife isnt for the rich people, this was made by the poor to get though life and somehow became a hashtag, idk. 

On my days off from work and I didnt feel like being around people I would adamantly drive over to the River and sit and read by the river all day. But I want to make this clear I stayed by the river for 2 reasons. Reason 1, It was beautiful and lovely to look at. Reason 2 GAS COST MONEY and money isnt something most VanLifers have. I cant afford to be driving around all the time and ever penny goes a long way. If you arent good with money your going to learn very quickly your going to need too be if you get into VanLifing. 100%, it 100% can save you a lot of money BUTTTTTTT your going to be living like a caveman for a year. A lot of people think they can be honest with themselves when asking how low teck they can live. Before you buy a van, go camping for a month NOT A WEEK and see how little you need and how much you can suffer. 

Also on my days off if it was raining and the river was flooding I would just sit in Walmart parking lots brain dead just listening to the rain. It was peaceful and beautiful and I found myself many days, but there were also days I was crying along with each raindrop as they died hitting my roof top. It's sad and its depressing living out a Van not matter how fancy it is! I would do this until 3pm because at 2pm a local coffee shop closes at that time, and me thinking about what would happen if cops coming up to my door as a black man (sad but true) , thought about how long it took for staff to clean up. So I would wait a hour until EVERYONE in the coffee shop was gone and the lights where off that I drove up to the parking lot closet to the coffee shop just to use the wifi and watch Netflix in peace. At the same time I would set a reminder on my phone to wake myself up at 4AM in the morning because they opened at 6am so I had to get out a hour early so they didnt see me. And if they did see me they would think ""oh its that homeless guy who lives out his Van he's normally gone before we open so he wont bug us"" I never got the cops called on me by them thankfully but it very well can happen no matter what color you are. 

So now its 4Am and you got nothing to do and no where to go, so you do the only thing you can do, Go to a 24hour fitness with your 10$ a month member ship and use the showers but not until you work out for 30mins so they dont catch on that your homeless.  If you think your that guy who will be like ""I don't care if people know im living out of my Van"" trust me you will, at least I hope you will because I found people who do are far better off. People don't want to help people who are homeless, and you might have some negative feelings about calling yourself homeless but if your a VanLifer even part time thats how the world is going to see you,, if not thats how they saw me. 

Now after you take your shower and workout you still have 1 or 2 hours  before anything is open, that time is easy to kill reading or playing games on your phone (the 24hour fitness has plug ins so you can charge your phone more) then from there it starts all over again. This isnt to mention dating. But since that different from person to person I wont talk about that. 

 This is not meant to be a ""your so naive"" post because I really REALLY loved living out my Van full time and I miss it and I would do it again is I didnt have my Cat. But she got me thought Covid and depression so I wont go back and force her into a small space. 
This post was created because I feel like way to many people are falling into the hashtag VanLife that they have 0 idea of what they really are getting into. All those fancy high dollar vans are shit and I cant think they even work all that well. I mean if you think of how well houses are made what makes you think they are going to put more effort into your van? If you can afford that type of van and want to get into VanLife, sure its your life do it but its far better to get a cheaper van and put that money aside and pay off debts. I hope this helped at least one person. I love you all, lets stay grounded to reality and hopefully bring a end to all this high dollar VanLife bs

VanLife,"I am so stuck. Looking for some input for a first timer who would be traveling the US and going camping for extended periods of time. I am 25 and not very experienced with mechanics nor van or RV upkeep if that makes any difference as well in your advice. 

Conversion van: 

Easy to get on the road quickly. Known to go for miles. Hoping for a high top but if not I feel like bending over all of the time could be annoying. Can tow a lot, so I could buy a travel trailer or a pop up camper to tow if I need more space. I think they‚Äôre bad on gas mileage because they‚Äôre big mama V8‚Äôs. I have never towed anything so that would be a learning curve for me as well. 

Toyota dolphin: 

It‚Äôs a freaking Toyota dolphin. I‚Äôm obsessed with them and they will only be useable for so long!!! Right now they‚Äôre all about 20-30 years old, but have the 22 RE which makes up for it. Vans don‚Äôt seem to be much newer anyways. Might run into issues with rust, leaks or water damage. Will have to learn all of the ropes on how to operate an RV. They‚Äôre small and compact so I bet they‚Äôre easier than a van towing a trailer to maneuver and I‚Äôd be more comfortable. Obviously it‚Äôs a full motor home so more space to renovate, fix or watch out for but also way more living space and I‚Äôll never have to crouch down. I‚Äôm not sure how much better gas mileage would be in a dolphin either, so that could be a downside. Also, finding a decent dolphin that I can get on the road right away is gonna cost me. Good because I can restore and probably sell it for the same amount I bought it or close to it... bad because I will probably pay double what I‚Äôd pay for a good to go conversion van. 

If you had to choose, what would your choice be? Any input is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",Conversion van vs Toyota dolphin
VanLife,"My fianc√© and I are going to be buying a van in the coming weeks/months and converting it to live in full time and travel throughout the US. The temperatures will vary drastically depending on the region we're in. We are looking at a Ram Promaster. The first one we looked at was white, and about $5,000 over our budget. We just came across one that is within our budget, but it is black. We are going to insulate it with Havelock wool and Reflectix, but are wondering if the black paint is going to attract more heat and turn our van into an oven. 

Has anyone converted/lived in a black van and was it unbearably hot ever, or did it not make a difference on the exterior paint color? 

Thanks!",Thoughts on a black van and heat?
VanLife,"I plan on doing van life for at least a few years, and if I jumped on it in my 20s I think would have given up on it fairly easy. There's three main points I wanted to highlight, then I'll state some things:

**1) Money** \- This is obviously the biggest concern with van life. If everyone had enough we'd all be buying up 80k Sprinters with 96V 12,000 watt solar systems. It's either you save up enough to be able to travel, or find a way to make income while on the road. In the past 6 years I've been working on making passive income. I worked 60 hours, saved up that extra money, and put it starting up side businesses for 10k. Then I invested that little side business revenue along with my job income into certain investments and ended up with 40k. With that money I could have easily started up a van life, but instead I decided to purchase a business space to start up my own coffee shop. This will prevent me from buying a van for at least 3 years, because I need to work at least 80hr/wk to manage this shop to grow it into a sustainable business, with the potential of opening up more coffee shops. So what I'm doing is setting up a foundation that is going to allow me to have income coming in.

My case is more extreme than most, but the point being is that **if you're thinking about van life, it's okay to not jump the gun and instead start building up the foundation.**

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Community** \- Especially with the pandemic the van life has really skyrocketed, and there are so many apps/ websites/ youtube channels dedicated to all of this since a good foundation has been laid for van dwellers. Youtube just has so much content about anything you need to look for, and most people are pretty good about responding.

For example, I have watched hundreds of videos on how solar powered energy works, what components are required, and now I can build a solid system at a fraction of the cost.

Same with heating/ air conditioning: I plan on making a video on how to build an air conditioning system using the method of thermal transfer that doubles as a cooler/fridge so you that you don't need to spend $1k on those overly expensive Dometic fridges (it draws about the same power as a compact/dorm fridge I don't know why people think those are better when it's smaller room and you now have to adjust to opening the door up instead of sideways). I learned through Youtube just how much more efficient it is to understand how those fridges work and how much insulation makes a bigger difference.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Technology/Build** \- I remember even five years back there weren't as many conversions on high top vans (transit/promaster/sprinter) decked with high powered solar systems. It was mostly cargo vans and the occasional vintage vans with roof extensions. So I thought I'd be fine with a Ford Econoline/ Chevy Astro if I could fit a bed in, a minimal kitchen space. But after the years have passed, I realized that I need a certain level of comfort in order for me to enjoy van life for **AT LEAST TWO YEARS**. If it's less than that I need to consider what I'm investing in and how that is going to be worth it, aside from the experience of being able to travel around. 

In the past 6 years I:

* worked in construction for year
* used those building skills to help build up a restaurant
* used the restaurant skills to start up a food truck 
* used all those things to start up my own cafe

With everything I've done up to this point, I now have the understanding of how to build the van from scratch, and be able to hook up plumbing/ electrical/ propane/ solar. With all this information, I have decided that I can build an affordable van for under 20k that can do more than what most of the youtube van lifers can do. My build is finding the most efficient/ affordable DIY builds for almost everything. This involves wanting the following:

* **12-16ft Box Truck**. Everyone seems to have the high top cargo vans, and while I see that as being more than sufficient, I personally don't think it's worth spending that much on a vehicle you could give up in less than a few years. I see so many van builds being sold on ebay/craigslist for 40k-80k and the problem is that because of all the work done in it (gutting out insides/ foam spray insulation) that the resell value of these vans don't go for that much. And people charge an astronomical amount for the items they bought and especially the work they put into it, but the issue with that is most people want to build it themselves to fit their needs, and do not have the money to invest all at once.
* **24V or 48V Solar Power system with DIY LiFePo4 battery cell system**. If all you need is power to run vent fans/ lights/ usb chargers, a 12V solar power system can be built for under $300.  A proper 24V/48V system could run as much as $5k-8k, but if you learn how to properly/safely create your own system you can have enough power to run a fridge/laptop/television for 1/3 of the cost. For now I plan on buying a small 12v system just to test out at home, learning how to wire/connect all the parts correctly and learning what mistakes I could possibly make.
* **100lb propane system for water tank/ heater/ stove with an oven**. Propane is cheapest for all these applications and is so efficient I don't know why anyone bothers getting an electric induction stove or heater. I also opt for 100lbs because I've owned a food truck with a 30lb propane tank and it was such a hassle to find places to fill up frequently. If you're also using one of those 5lb tanks that you can swap out at a big box store, the cost to maintain that will far outweigh initially setting up a proper system, even within half a year. This is one of the reasons a box truck comes in handy, so you can make a separate compartment to install this.
* **Proper plumbing system for kitchen and bathroom/shower**. Up until a few months back I have never thought I would want/ need a shower or toilet for the van and all I would need is a Planet Fitness membership. The thought of setting it up/ the space it takes/ how to even clean a toilet and the smell/ possible mold from the humidity, all made me not even consider it. However, after seeing many builds, a lot have opted for a shower with a compostable toilet (with vent) inside, and I now want to build a closed door bathroom, but with shower/ toilet separated. If I already have a 12V pump/ propane heater for the sink, it doesn't cost extra to run it, just extra building materials. I also plan to host friends, and it would make everyone feel less weird to have them find a pee jar or look for a bathroom all the time. 
* There is a lot more that I want to add, but honestly I also am usually one to learn as I go, and also be able to add as I go, so I plan on building the van out where I can make modifications much easier down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say that people will start figuring out more efficient/ convenient ways of navigating around van life, and this is all totally doable if you're willing to commit the time to it.

My biggest concern is money, I have no idea how I'll make money while I'm living in my van. I don't want to stay in one area for long so financial security is probably going to be an issue.
Another thing I'm worried about is theft, it is so much easier to have someone smash a window and grab the few things of value you have in a van than breaking into a house or apartment. Are there any measures I can take to keep that from happening aside from hoping my alarm will go off when someone's close enough to hear it.
I also don't know what sort of van I should buy. Ideally I'd want something cheap but with decent gas milage, plus I am around 6 feet tall so I'm worried about headspace.

VanLife,"Hello all, 

I've been think and planning on starting van life for the past year, just waiting for covid and life to straighten out a bit, then i'm off on the adventure. I've never owned / bought a car before, and of the whole project the parts that worries me the most is the buying of the van. I dont know what makes one van good/bad, what a good asking price, where i could buy one (currently in NYC). How to check that its good and won't break down, or where i can learn to fix up smaller problems. 

Ideally i'd love to buy a used electric Camper on the smaller side, and tall enough for me to stand in (i'm 5""10,) but those usall tend to be sooo expensive, I'm open to any van, I'd also rather get a van that costs more upfront but wont require as much cost and upkeep down the road.  and have a general budget of 6,500 for the van. 

And help, recomendation, evaluation, tips would be greatly appreciated.

VanLife,"Just wanted to share with the vanlife community.  On our Sprinter van, we don't have solar.  We do have the Goal Zero Yeti 1000 battery pack.  Goal Zero manufactures a device called the Yeti Link Expansion Car Link Module which will let you charge the Yeti using your alternator.  But - you most likely need to update your firmware, it is a proprietary device that will only work with the Goal Zero line of products, it uses up the space for the MPPT controller (so you can't run the Car Link module and the MPPT module at the same time) and if you wanted it today - they are out of stock until the Spring of 2021 for technical enhancements.  

I put together a video showing you how I charge the Yeti 1000 using a Victron Orion DC-DC charger.  Connections are super simple.  Connect positive and negative from your starter battery to the Victron Orion.  Connect positive and negative from the Orion to a vertically stacked Anderson Power Pole plug.  Then connect it to the Input side of the Goal Zero.

The Goal Zero battery pack works very well - we love it!  Charging it while we drive (without solar!) is a huge plus - it charges at just under 360W.  So in less than 3 hours I can go from a near empty battery to full.  

I will never drain my starter battery with this setup - in the Victron Connect app I set the ON/OFF parameters when the Victron Orion will charge.  It is also isolated from the vehicle electrical system, and the Orion also has it's own built in fuse.  Some neat features!  

In my Sprinter van, I leave it connected all the time.  If I run errands, I'm always charging the battery.  Super important to have something like this when you live in the northern hemisphere where the days are short, and there is no sunshine due to rain (Vancouver Canada!) and snow (Toronto!)

Hope this helps you.  Here's a link to the video I put together:

Would you like to own two vans, store one securely, and swap from summer to winter? More effort to build out, but the summer one could skip insulation and heat to maximize space, have an outdoor shower set up and an exterior kitchen (minivan camper would be plenty if you're not in need of AC). The winter one could be more built out, with an indoor kitchen and shower (if at all), diesel heater, and of course insulation. Could also optimize the underlying vehicle for the various terrains you would encounter in each season. 

Mostly this is just idle fantasy as a I procrastinate, but curious if anyone's seriously considered this. Obviously the biggest issue (besides the initial cost to build out two vans) is storage, since you would be away from one of the vehicles half the year.",Winter van and Summer van?

VanLife,"TL;DR: Van life throws curve balls; Do bring pup for emotional well-being.

Hi there, long time reader here, first time posting.

I‚Äôm writing from a Motel 6, unable to sleep, and just a bit overwhelmed by it all. Not quite what I had pictured for my first extended stay in my van.

I‚Äôm a week into travelling in my self-converted 2016 RAM Promaster 1500, ~63K miles. It had been looked over by two separate mechanics around last August, and after a few minor repairs, I was told it has a clean Bill of health.  But this week, the Check Engine Light came on twice. 

The first mechanic I took it to in North Carolina cleared the error codes and explained to me that Promasters are prone to false alarms for oil pressure. He seemed honest and even refused my money when I tried to pay him. 

But then, the dreaded light came on again yesterday, en route to South Carolina. This time, I took it to a Pep Boys and after a $100 diagnostic test, I got news that there‚Äôs issues with my transmission. Since this branch of Pep Boys does not do transmission repairs, they sent me to a mechanic they recommended. 

There, I was told my transmission‚Äôs torque converter and clutch solenoid both had to be replaced, and that luckily, they had the parts on hand and could make it an overnight job. The total quote was $1900 plus tax. 

This is a pretty big sum to me, but I just bit the bullet and agreed to it. I asked if I could stay in my van overnight when they weren‚Äôt working on it, but it was a no-go, so I found a Motel 6 which was a 40min walk away. 

I‚Äôm trying to stay positive, and think of this expensive repair as something preemptive of even more costly consequences farther down the line. But it‚Äôs certainly hard not to second guess if I had made the right decisions under pressure... Or if there might be something more to learn from this experience? I‚Äôm certainly freaking out a bit at the financial repercussions of today.

Van lifers, do you have tips for dealing with days like these? Or on how to get more educated on van maintenance?

All I can say is I am sure glad I have my pup with me right now. He is my little anchor! I can‚Äôt wait to be back in my van, and to put this all behind me.

VanLife," The Public House Project is a re-imagining of modern American life. It combines the growing movements of van life with the idea of a co-housing community.¬† At the heart of the community is the shared house.¬† No one lives long term in the house.¬† It is decorated and stocked with¬† every thing you need to cook, including basic grocery items, locally sourced as much as possible. Homes are stylish, modern, comfortable homes to share.¬†  


Guests rent private, small parking areas, or rent a small tent in a private area.¬† All vehicles and tents include, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.¬† Costs of renting a place is still being worked out, but we aim to be very reasonable for everything you get, and totally flexible, come and go as you please.   


On the grounds of the property it is up to the community to decide what they'd like. Some ideas include growing gardens, building ninja obstacles for fun workouts, and/or install solar and make the house as green as possible.  Down the road we aim to make homes co-owned by those who live at them.  


The Public House Project is a better, more social, less expensive, more energy efficient way to live.¬† Imagine a network of Public Homes across of these United States. Move for fun, move for work, move for a relationship, you'll still have your home and your community there when you want it, when you need it.

Submissions should be one page (multiple pages will be considered individually): campsite/hike map, writing, or combo. Everything should be handwritten/drawn (nothing typed). 

Campsites should be free, public, specifically designated as a campsite (no stealth required), and be a lesser-known site (we want to lessen our impact by using less trafficked areas, instead of overusing the most popular spots). All campsites should have 2WD road access (no 4x4 or backpacking/walk-in sites). Finally, you should have hiked the hike or spent the night at the site in either January or February 2021 (we want to know how the campsite is in WINTER -- snowy is fine).

Writing should focus on one of the following themes: low impact camping/travel, leave no trace, wilderness ethics, perseverance, resilience, grit, outdoor living, van life, hope, counter-culture, resistance, etc. 

You can submit as many pages as you'd like. It's important to me to pay people for their art -- if accepted, contributors will be paid $10/page, payment upon publication (late March or early April).

VanLife,"Perhaps the community has experience with this:

Generally speaking, Renters Insurance covers your ""stuff"" anywhere in the world. There are exclusions -- things like high value electronics, jewelry, artwork and instruments often require separate riders.

But if you have your bag in the trunk of your car stolen, your renters insurance policy will generally cover that loss (after the deductible). 

But what about the contents of a van? **And what about the _retrofit itself_?** Can the cost of the materials be claimed in case of loss, like a fire, _against a renter's insurance policy_?

If it was an apartment fire, yes, you could claim the cost of your bed and furniture. But what if it is in a van?

You couldn't claim the sweat equity, obviously. But what about the cost of materials if you have the receipts.

If someone knows some resources on this, I'd love to do some more reading. I've not see anything explicit yet.

I'd put all my stuff in storage or put it with family and have a place for my cat be it boarding or family and wait out the 2-4 months it should take for a opening to appear.

So I just finished installing the floor in my van.  I'm going to leave it as plywood because fuck it, it's a cheap build.    However I'm torn between staining it or painting it.  I've finished sanding it and I am leaning towards stain.

I've done some googling and I can use one of the polyurethane stains that protect and stain in one can.  The other advantage is that I can paint over it if I don't like it.  However, the reverse isn't possible; I cant stain over paint.

INFO: i‚Äôll have about a 500AH battery bank and 950W in solar, and a 2000W inverter charger.

my question is- between a 120V and 12V fridge- is the actual AH consumed that much different? i know part of the issue is in the inverter being on 24/7, which I figured I could fix by attaching a small 300W inverter to the back of the fridge, which should be an almost negligible daily power draw, maybe 4 amps a day (am i wrong?).

if I were to do that, will the 120V fridge still end up drawing more power? i‚Äôve read the size i‚Äôm looking at (3.2 cu ft) draws about 50-100W, whereas the same size 12V draws 180W. 

am i missing something in the conversions here? should i just give up and settle for an ugly $500 12V fridge?

I have Victron components so it would be really nice to integrate with that, but Victron's DC-DC chargers are really expensive and don't connect up with their other products.

I've looked into installing dual alternators and into installing a different voltage regulator on my current alternator, but those are both extremely expensive and involved as well.

I've been interested in van life for a while to travel and work remotely. But I can't seem to find a suitable van that's already converted for under $10k. I've no real interest in converting a van myself.

However, I can find plenty of cars for that price range. And discovered r/urbancarliving

I've done long stretches of travel before in a car, so I'm wondering if there's anyone who's done both that can provide any insights on the differences.

VanLife,"So I'm looking to buy a Chevy Astro/Safari, and although they have an option for a higher roof, it has a few drawbacks - they're more expensive, they lose the 'stealth' factor a bit, and they aren't flat on the top so mounting solar panels isn't an option. And I also think they're ugly.

So I got to thinking, what if I mounted a large aluminum diamond-plate tool box to the top of the van and simply cut a large hole in the roof? Is that going to work? Something this: [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0756/6913/products/utility-box-golf-cart-aluminum-diamond-plate\_x1400.jpg?v=1603139298](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0756/6913/products/utility-box-golf-cart-aluminum-diamond-plate_x1400.jpg?v=1603139298)

* How much is insurance usually? Is gas ""expensive"" usually?

VanLife,"It's my first post in this sub so nice to meet everything and wish you all a happy new year! 

I appreciate some advice to kick off my very first and probably the most important step - which is getting the van. 

I tried with SUV camping before jumping in with more investment into this lifestyle and I know I absolutely love it. So now comes down to a few choices: 

* I can buy a cargo van and do the conversion myself
* Buy an RV Van that has already been converted
* Or find someone to do it for me 

Budget wise I have enough to put down on a house, and I think I'll just spend a portion of that on a van, but being more money conscious I'd prefer to spend less if possible. 

Prebuilt RV van is an easy option and a peace of mind too but comes with its price tag (100k+ I believe), and also not that stealth in street parking given they all comes with that RV paint style which I also dislike. 

But I'm also not that handy, so building my own van would be a daunting task to say the least, unless there's resource online that can hand-hold me throughout this process. 

If not, then it comes down to the third option (to commision someone to do it for me). I have absolutely no idea how costly it is (my expectation on the outcome is one of those nice-looking vans you will see on social media), and if that will bring it still cheaper than a prebuilt RV van then it may be a no-brainer to go with this option. That said, I also struggle to find a van conversion company (and I live in bay area which is probably not the easiest place to find that I guess). 

That's my story, and hope to get some good advice.",[Need advice] How to kick off my vanlife? Facing severail choices.

My online name is Sierra Night Tide (different reasons.) I've been doing Van Life, off and on for more than 10 years.

Got a class B and now I'm slowly fixing it up and making it mine. Living in an apartment in a major city is (for me) really difficult; especially during these times.

A few months ago my key fob to my sprinter van fell apart and I lost all the pieces inside (I was in the middle of a store or something, I can't even remember now) I didn't think anything of it because my van is being worked on right now and I haven't needed to crank it. Of course I go to crank it today and it's giving me a starter error. Google tells me that it could be because of not having the chip that was in the key fob to match the computer in the van so it won't crank. Great. Unfortunately I didn't even know that was a thing!

VanLife,"I've been looking and comparing vans for over a year and I need an advice with choosing my first one. It'll be used for commuting and camping in Scotland, budget up to ¬£8k.
Because of this my initial choice was a medium sized van with higher mpg like Vivaro or Transit. However I'd like to be able to fit a kitchen and have enough space for two people and gear during trips, so I'm worried these models might not be enough. 
I've also noticed that bigger vans (master, boxer, etc) are cheaper and maintened better across UK.

This video was recorded at Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve on Vancouver Island, Canada. 

The video is primarily a review of the 29 litre Mobicool V30, 12 volt DC Cooler/Warmer. It also serves as a tutorial on how I compartmentalize to maximize the limited storage capacity of this small cooler. Using a small shelf and a number of small storage containers, I am able to pack away a considerable amount of perishable food. 

The video ends with a short walk from the parking area to Long Beach, followed by a walk along the beach. The scenery is breathtaking!

I am relatively new regarding sleeping in a Van / living for several days in a van.

When we (my 2 kids + wife) sleep in the Van (T5) the windows are completely wet in the morning. 

For sure 4 people breathe a lot. 

So it is normal that you have to clean / dry it in the morning?

Or can I do something else?

VanLife,"Hello, friends! Wishing you a safe and warm winter season.

TL;DR: Getting a bigger vehicle for urban car living. passenger van (eg, Ford Escape) vs. mini cargo van (Ford Transit Connect). Similar prices.

I'm about to have to leave my apartment, so will be moving into a car full time in the next couple weeks. I currently have a 2008 Ford Focus which I have lived out of for about a week in the past; however, that is too small to be sustainable.

I'm weighing pros and cons of each van type. Gas mileage, style/shape, price, and most other factors are roughly equal. The one difference is that I like the greater storage capacity of the cargo van, but have worries about stealth and security. It will stand out wherever I park it and I am nervous about becoming a target for damage or theft. I don't plan to do a fancy build or anything, but don't want to throw out all of my clothes and crafting supplies. I'm downsizing for sure, but the passenger van will have *very* little storage space. I also like the idea of the cargo van since it seems more bearable for longer term car living and intermittent travel/car camping. I have places to be during the day (with water, showers, heat, electricity, etc.), so will mostly only be sleeping in the van. I want to plan for a bearable place to be for a couple days at a time as needed though.

Is this something you've considered? Have you lived in either/both and have thoughts on security and stealth? Would love to hear your thoughts!",Passenger Van vs. Cargo Van (X-Post from urbancarliving)

These public comments are very important because each letter is required by law to be read. The Biden administration has said that they will shut this down day 1, but words are words. SO it is important that our voices are heard, and we will do that by writing letters so that we cannot be ignored. 

With the link I‚Äôve attached at the bottom you can write a letter expressing your concerns, but if you do not feel like, or do not have the time there is a prewritten letter that hits all the key concerns already typed out for you to send off. The only requirement to send a letter is that you must be a resident in the United States of America, there is no age restrictions.

We want something versatile and yet with enough room for us to comfortably setup a laptop each on the table and sit for 8 hours a day during the work week.

VanLife," Hey [r/vanlife](https://www.reddit.com/r/vanlife/)

I'm curious to know your advice on ways to keep some consistent routines and habits while living on the road.

I have the privilege of working from home and not because of covid, I earn location independent income and work for myself. I love the opportunities van life presents itself and it's a lifestyle I feel I would enjoy.

I do have some concerns however, I have some routines and habits I would like to be able to keep. I'm a gym regular and I like to wake up early each day. Getting proper sleep and a good workout in each day are big for me. I'd imagine having to find a place to sleep each night could become a huge hassle. On top of that, I sometimes have to take important phone calls with clients and be able to actually get work done and remain productive and in fact, I enjoy working and having to utilize my skillset as opposed to sleeping around all day. Is there any recommended places to park during the day to get work done in a somewhat quiet environment?

I know van life won't be a smooth transition as this is an alternative lifestyle but I have seen a few business owners giving it a shot. So I feel I could also adopt the lifestyle if I'm willing to get rid of some simple comforts and make some sacrifices. I feel that the payoff is way better in comparison to owning fancy material things and a big house I would never actually utilize.

Any advice would be well appreciated and I apologize in advance if these questions have been asked repeatedly already.","Full-Time Van Lifers, How Do You Manage To Establish Routines and Form Consistent Habits While On The Road?"

recently bought a ford transit, I guess it's a mk6 but actually will have to wait for the log book to be sent back to my postal address to find out.

Questions:

to fit insulation - can i just tape it? bought a roll of aluminium foil tape earlier.

moisture resistance - can I just fit a polythene sheet on the near side of the insulation? how do I actually 'secure' it? I am guessing it shouldn't be too tight to the insulation as well, is that true or does it not matter?

in the ribs of the body - have I done a stupid thing by buying a litres' worth of soudal expanding foam? where can I look for a good guide to instal it without popping the ribs or whatever?

I will probably ask a few follow questions if anyone is able to help me out, apologies for this!  
best wishes all

previous owner kitted it out for summer, but from what I've read/heard it sounds like their sticking of a reflective layer to the body would only have aided heat conduction anyway, now it is bloody freezing in there, I've taken out one side's worth of reflective material, going to clean off what remains of the glue/adhesive tonight on that side at least, might take the other panels off too.

VanLife,"Hi all - I‚Äôm looking to get some information and recommendations about the equipment Id like to install in my tiny camper for next spring-fall camping season.

I converted a 5x8 6‚Äô tall cargo trailer into a camper for my 4 person family. Bunk beds go sideways in the back for my 6 and 2 year old, there‚Äôs a cabinet, fold up  wall mounted table, and my wife and I have a mattress pad that doubles as a couch and bed on the floor.

Normally when we sleep my feet are under the bottom bunk because it‚Äôs raised and I‚Äôm over 6‚Äô tall, but my wife is just over 5‚Äô and she doesn‚Äôt need the foot space on her side. So under that side of the bunk I plan to install a 32 L fridge. It‚Äôll fit perfectly almost like the bunk was made for the fridge. Lucked out with how perfect the fit is.

It‚Äôs a 45W fridge. So I‚Äôm not sure how much I need for a battery and what kind of solar panel will keep that battery charged appropriately. The fridge is roughly 3.75 Ah when the compressor is running, and if I overestimate that 40% of the time the compressor will be running I figure it‚Äôll probably work out to maybe 1.5 Ah. So I‚Äôd need approximately 36-40 amp hours per day for the fridge.

I don‚Äôt plan running anything else off the battery. I also have a 50,000mAh battery pack for phones, and our lights and fans are rechargeable and last the whole weekend when we camp.

Would a single 100 Ah deep cycle battery be fine for that fridge? Would a 60-100W panel be enough to keep the battery mostly full if only the fridge was drawing from it?","12v fridge, battery, and solar."

* Smaller pieces so might be easier to cut around structurals bits of van and contour to the shape
* Easier to remove a single piece or two if needed in the future

Pros for plywood:

* Structurally stronger and I could attach things directly into this (shelving etc)

VanLife,,Solar panels are up!
VanLife,"Hi friends! Today, I was staying inside my vehicle outside the back of a Sear's parking lot, and while I was working on some business, I have my solar panels and solar generator hooked up in order to use my laptop during the day. Anyways, this police officer came up next to me. Then he lit up his sirens for a second to grab my attention, and I thought I was in trouble. Great, my second interaction with the police because I'm ""homeless living in a vehicle"" and somebody decided to be all judgmental and call the police. This dude was a supervisor, too!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, he noticed my solar set up, and asked me questions about it. He wanted to know what my generator was, how much power I was pulling in, how long I can stay without solar, etc. So many questions, and luckily I had a lot of answers for him from my research into solar for the last half a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

This police officer supervisor, who looked like he was in his 50's or 60's, was completely jealous of my set up. He was baffled by the fact that I could work behind a Sear's parking lot, but I explained to him I have unlimited cellular in order to connect to WiFi essentially anywhere. And that made him even more intrigued, and jealous of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

He asked about my expenses, and then his jaw dropped. Living rent-free means lowered expenses means incredible money making opportunities. And with solar, I personally don't see why anybody would want to buy a house. Sure, we're not making the 3% passive income every year from owning a house, but we have so little expenses it doesn't really matter, and can focus our money on other things, like bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just felt the need to share. Because knowing that a 50's or 60's year old is jealous of me, a person younger than 30, is something that is an absolutely incredible feeling, personally. This dude has worked his entire life, day in, day out, as a police officer, serving the betterment of society, all for society to hate on him, and he's financially struggling so much he's leaving the state and building an off-grid house to decrease his expenses. That's just sad... Dude worked his entire life serving the community, and he can't even retire. But that's  life now, and we must adapt. Living paycheck to paycheck, paying 1/3 of your income to rent, 5 out of 7 days of your entire life, only to retire at 65 to have.. maybe 10 okay ish years of retirement? That's ridiculous! You're working 40+ years to enjoy 10 years. No thank you. I want to enjoy life now.",A friendly police interaction! &lt;3 Lil' story.

We‚Äôre in Spain but the car is taxed and registered in the UK, we could get it changed to Spanish, but we‚Äôd have to go through the vehicle inspection and the rust on the chassis of the van isn‚Äôt going to pass that inspection unfortunately, so we‚Äôre stuck there.

VanLife,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons, but bear with me.

My partner and I are residents of Florida. We moved in 4ish years ago, rented apartments and did everything by the book when it comes to drivers licenses, insurance, etc etc.

We decided that we can work from the road and bought a towing vehicle planning to build up a travel trailer to work from anywhere we can get cell phone reception. We just cancelled our lease, got rid of everything that did not fit in our cars, and came up to New England to spend the holidays and start getting our towing vehicle ready for our future adventures.

For address, we decided to remain as residents of Florida, and we are paying a mail forwarding service that explicitly allows to use their address as ""permanent address"", and we are planning on switching our drivers licenses and auto insurance to that location.

Now, here's my problem: auto insurance requires a garage address. We do not live, nor park our vehicle in the address we will be using for residence. So legally, this may be seen as a misrepresentation. I would not like to get in a situation in which my insurance denies a claim and I have to cover liability.

So, for the next 1, 2 or even 3 years, I won't have a real residential address, and the car will be parked in whatever campground, free land or park that we decide to visit. Is it possible for someone to be able to do this and be 100% covered on their auto insurance? even if calling them and updating our real location?

VanLife,"I turn 26 in February and get off my parents insurance. Legally, I live in Massachusetts but practically I live in a 2000 Dodge Roadtrek in California. As I look for insurance options, I've realized the absurd complexity of it all and am wondering what van lifers do for health insurance. 

For context, I'm a very healthy about-to-be-26 year old and I'm looking for insurance that will cover major medical expenses (i.e. emergency surgery, expensive ER visits, or catastrophic medical things).I don't need insurance for preventative care/routine checkups. 

As a resident of Massachusetts, I've looked into Blue Cross Blue Shield's cheapest plan - the HMO Blue Essential planter $338/month - but it doesn't cover any out-of-network major costs, which would render it effectively useless in places other than MA. 

One big q I have is about World Nomads and other travel insurances that have health plans. World Nomads does cover health insurance up to $100K in their Standard insurance. However, World Nomads is considered a ""secondary"" health insurance, which (I think) would cover things that a primary insurance doesn't cover. BUT what if I didn't have a primary insurance? Would WN cover me? 

Are there van lifers out there or nomads in the US that use World Nomads as their ONLY health insurance? 

And in general, what do van lifers do for insurance without paying absurd costs? My budget is $300-400 per month",Health Insurance for van lifers within the US

I‚Äôm converting to vanlife to travel and work myself out of my crippling debt, so I was so happy that I traded in for free, and the dealership did work for free, and now they will have to do more work for free because I just discovered that the drivers side door isn‚Äôt locking from the inside, outside, or with the faab. Also the abs light turned on. I am now realizing how much rust the van has.. I mean theres rusted holes in the floor, there‚Äôs gaps around the doors.. I‚Äôm going to be insulting and putting up walls, but now I‚Äôm so worried that it won‚Äôt all be enough with all that rust.
I typically remain positive about these things, after all, things can be fixed. I‚Äôm in the worst financial situation of my life right now. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt have any money saved, and over 10k in cc debt. I haven‚Äôt been working due to being sick... I‚Äôm so worried all the sudden that this won‚Äôt work out.. that this van is going to keel over the moment I try and drive out of state.

VanLife,"So, now that it's my first winter in my van... my panels are not cutting it.  I have 300w of panels and 200ah of Li batteries, and a couple days of overcast weather and I'm a sitting duck.  I'm going to install a DC-DC charger to connect my AGM car battery with my Li house batteries and tap into the power being produced by my 135a alternator.

I'm going with a DC-DC charger instead of an isolator because I've read they are safer for the alternator, and give you more control (can manually turn on/off instead of being forced to run on a timer or all the time).

Some questions though:  I have seen that alternators can burn out if you are running a DC-DC charger while idling.  How can I mitigate that risk?  I'd like to be able to idle my engine for 30 minutes here and there while camp is set up, to top up my Li batteries, but not if I'm going to be running the risk of damaging my alternator or starting a fire.

Also, how hard is it to set up so that I can turn it on/off manually instead of it just starting with the ignition switch?  My primary means of charging will still be my panels.  Do most chargers have a switch on the unit where I can just set to on/off as I please?

Finally- how do I monitor how much charge I'm taking in? Do I just assume it will always be running at capacity, so if I have a 40a DC-DC and I run the engine for an hour, I just gained 40ah?  Is there any way to be more precise and maybe monitor the exact current like I can with my panels via Charge Controller and Bluetooth module?

this article seems to have the best set up ive seen so far: [Here](https://www.cheaprvliving.com/conversion-details/4x4-van-conversion-sleeping-in-a-hammock-in-a-van/). Another article reccomended bolting eye bolts near a hole so I can reach in and manangle it tightened on the inner metal bits. 

I cant find many builds where yall use a hammock so I wanted to make a post and ask for thoughts and suggestions before I go all the way and make holes or do something I didnt think all the way through.   
pros for hammocking full time: space saver: easy to put up, quick to take down, underquilt for heat is cheap, no breeze inside van to make you cold so bundle up as much as you want in the winter or as little as you need in the summer, park at angle and sleep just fine.   
cons: one person at most (for safety reasons sadly), uncomfy for some, takes getting used to, might not be warm enough all winter (alone), could possibly hang wrong.

VanLife,"My fianc√© and I have been talking about living the dream at some point next year and going full time in our 2012 Ford e350 15 passenger van. I‚Äôve done all the work myself so far and I‚Äôm confident me and my brother (we both work in the trades) could install a high top roof but I‚Äôve spent hours searching online and literally can‚Äôt find one that will ship to me. 

Fiberine is the only option I‚Äôve found and it would be 6-7k depending if I want them to add windows and do a ceiling fan. We live in NorCal but my brother lives down south so we could drive down, drop the van off at Fiberine and stay with him while they do the upgrade. 

My fianc√© and I play music and have a band together. We bought the van about 6 years ago for that reason, and we‚Äôve already circled the country quite a few times and driven through Canada in jt. At the time of purchase it had 40k miles, it‚Äôs now at 220k. It‚Äôs currently in the shop getting axle and brake work done but other than that it‚Äôs still going strong. 

It would be awesome to not have to spend that much on a raised roof so we can continue saving and doing the other upgrades, but being able to stand up in the van is pretty close to a necessity if we‚Äôre both gonna be in there full time. 

TL:DR - Fiberine wants 7k to do my raised roof. I‚Äôm super handy, are there any other options because I can‚Äôt find any.

VanLife,"Hey guys,
Not sure who I should come to with this idea but I wanted to get some feedback on the best way to do this.  Im going to be doing some camping in my trailer in some cold alpine environments (in the teens and below at night) and am looking for an alternative to propane for heating.  I could camp pretty close to some hot springs and I had this idea to use them as a potential heat source. (dont worry about fumes, camped here many times without the camper).  I want to run a hose from the springs, through a radiator + fan combi or something like that inside the trailer then hose back to the stream.  Itll depend on a few variables but I think that I can park the trailer in a way that the inlet is a bit higher elevation than the outlet hose which means that I could run it continuously as a siphon instead of running a pump.

Has anyone had any experience with something like this?  If im using a 3/4"" hose and need to pump the water about 30' and up maybe 5', what size pump would you use? Any other thoughts on the best heat exchanger?

Anyways, I've got a 1977 VW Camper with a stock 30 amp/12 volt alternator which is connected to a standard Optima starting battery. The starting battery is connected to a Renogy DCC50S DC-DC MPPT solar charge charger which is connected to two roof-mounted 160 Watt Renogy solar panels and two Renogy 200 ah Gel Hybrid aux batteries. I'd like to add the ‚ÄúRenogy 2000 Watt 12V DC to 120V AC Pure Sine Wave Inverter Charger‚Äù ( PCL1-20111S ) to the mix, however, I'm concerned about how the two Renogy chargers will behave.

\-Should I connect the PCL1-20111S directly to the aux batteries along with the DCC50S or should I connect the PCL1-20111S to the starting battery and let the DCC50S send the charge from the starting battery to the aux batteries?

\-If I have both the solar (via the DCC50S) and shore power (via the  PCL1-20111S) directly connected to the aux batteries, which will do the charging? Will one take precedence? Will they both switch on and off rapidly as the voltage rises and falls due to the chargers detecting the incoming voltage as the battery voltage? Or will they both just work together to charge the batteries?

VanLife,"Hey guys, one of my first real posts on Reddit here.

I'm currently finishing up my second year of getting a bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture. Recently I've been thinking about what I want to do after graduating with a degree. I've been thinking about living on the road, traveling around and camping for a few years, longer if I am able to, and exploring. One of the main things that I need to do to make this happen is to make passive income so that I can stay out longer.

So, does anyone know about how freelance LA work would be? Designing online without having to actually be in one spot to be in meetings or things like that? Any help would be appreciated if anyone does this kind of work while out exploring, and if I only get bad news it would still be helpful!

VanLife,"hi y'all! i'm currently in the electricity stage of my van build plan, and was wondering which set up you guys thought would be more practical. or if one is even possible lol

i'm planning on having 760 watts of solar panels, and also hooking up my system to my alternator. 

i've (guess)timated that my daily consumption would be around 220AH.  first question- would \~400AH stored be a go? the recommendation i've gotten from the calculators online is 700-800 AH stored, but i can't ever see myself not getting ANY charge from the solar or alternator for two days. or am i crazy.

second question- which would be better, 4 100AH lithium ion batteries + inverter + isolators + all the bits and pieces (and lots of time) needed to assemble (aka \~$4k) OR 2 bluetti solar power stations (400AH total) ($3.4k).  using the 2 bluettis seems like a slightly cheaper, easier way to get this done, but am i missing something? am i entertaining an impossible reality? lol

thank you in advance for any input! (also, pls no comments that i should just not use so much power)",using lithium ion batteries vs bluetti power stations

Essentially, I want air con or cooling of some kind for when I'm sleeping. And want to be able to use it for a couple (3-6) hours each night on a week or two week long road trip. I won't be expecting to use it off grid pro-longed, but I'm driving all day i will be generating power. 

My options / ideas are as follows:

1. Get a fan and suck it up 
2. Buy household plug in air con unit, and a petrol or diesel generator which I will put underneath the van outside and run the lead through the door seal and power the air con, refilling the generator each day when stopping for fuel
3. Buy a good inverter, and power it from my van battery directly, and leave the engine running and after its nice and chilly turn it off
4. Buy the zerobreeze mark2 and recharge it on the road each day

Does anyone have any input at all, or ideas for staying cool in 30-40C at night?",Air Conditioning
VanLife,"Not sure what foam is the best to insulate from noise and temperature. If you have experience with either of my suggestions let me know - or something else?

I want to build these window covers with blackout on one side and something like white sunbrella on the outside. I've heard of [3m SM600L](https://www.promasterforum.com/threads/3m-thinsulate-sm600l-vehicle-insulation-available.36369/) as a good filler for these kind of shades. Another idea is to use polyetheline in 3 or 6 mm (1/8-1/4""). I like that PE or EVA foam would be fairly rigid and could be stored like cardboard on the side in a crack somewhere (I think?).

VanLife,"Hello,

I share some photos of my van.

I moved out of my apartment in the summer, and into this sprinter van in the spring. I'm in my 30s now, and ever since I was in high school, I always wanted to big 'ole van. I had hitch hiked and stealth camped in my early 20s. 

I had been looking at sprinters since 2017. I went to the dealership. They said with covid, next year's production is uncertain, and they are clearing out their older inventory. 

When I bought it, it was crammed with seats. I took those out, but kept a row so I could make a 5 seater if needed. But as you might have seen, it's just a metal room on wheels with windows.

I've been living out of it for several months, and have driven across country a couple times. Now there are lockdowns, and it is much safer that I have a semi-permanent stay. 

As is, the vehicle is not temperature controlled, so it isn't very livable during the winter. There is no insulation, and the floor, walls, and ceiling are bare. There are many good modifications to do with this van, but I'm not committed to spending time on the van.

Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I wanted to get this out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Insulation

Roof Vent Fan

Sub floor

Flooring

Bed frame

Shower

Electrical

Solar Panels

I'm currently working on installing the walls, and doing a couple of other things. My initial plan was to have this project finished in August, however, between Covid Shutdowns and Social distancing, the project keeps getting stalled. I am not proficient with tools, and have almost no construction skills or knowledge. Everything I've done so far has been with help, trial-and-error, advice, and Youtube.   


I have most of the supplies for the build already purchased. I don't have a lot of the tools, and have been using the help of parents, and a couple of friends to get the job done. However, their time is only available during weekends, and those weekends that are available for them is few and far between. Not a fault of their own, just a conflict of schedule.   


The problem I'm facing right now: I SUCK at construction, and I could really use some guidance, teaching, and help, finishing the project. I have funds built up, materials purchased, and an open schedule. I'm looking to find anyone in the lower 48 that would be willing for me to drive out to where you are. I'm willing to pay for the help! I want the finishing steps (mainly cabinets) to look decent, and if I had a crack at it, it will probably come out pretty rough.

The Espar is using its built-in temperature sensor to figure out when to turn off / on the unit.  Since it's located in a contained space, it's probably much warmer in there, and therefore the rest of the van isn't staying warm because it's adjusting for its little space, not the actual van.

So I'm considering buying an add-on, which is an external temperature sensor. They seem to run $65.

VanLife,"In a flat im not even living from month to month and feel i'll endessly be stuck in this cycle of debt. So i want to save money for a year to try to get myself out of the cycle. So I want to know some tips to spend as little as possible living in a van. I have very basic needs and I cant afford to do an amazing van conversion. Im hoping some people have tried just basic matress in a van and thats it. Or if not, whats the absolute basics?

As an overview, im happy to spend my days working where I can, on hikes, in libraries, malls, even vounlenteering, etc. The van is mostly for just sleeping.   
Here are the elements i've considered:

**Toilet:** During the day ill probably by covered by public services or places im wokring/voulenteering, but at night, im less sure. I've looked a bit into ""wag"" bags and chemical toilets. What's the cheapest solution? I'm ok to empty the toilet daily if i need to.   
**Water:**  I assume I can utliize public water supplies for my basic drinking water needs. But what about for things like general washing, etc, what are some good suggestions?  
   
**Power:** All I need is my phone occasionally to stay in touch (daily check in really is it). Maybe listen to some music or playing a game from time to time...let's say a full charge would last me 2 days. and basic lighting when I need it at night. So would a small solar power panel do the trick? Also, can you use public libraries, etc to charge during the day? 

**Food:** im very unfussy for food. Eg, I can easily eat chikpeas and lentils every day and not mind. I'm more concerned for health reasons to get all my vitamins. Suggestions on cheap eating that wont give me scurvvy? Honestly, ill eat the same meal every day i dont mind.  I'd buy a little camping stove too

**Accomidation / Parking:** I'm not doing this to travel, im doing this to live/survive. Are there any places that are cheaper / better for long term stays? For example, I even know that people rent out their car spaces, id be fine with this. my van would just be for sleeping and relaxing. To get the most opportunities for casual work, I need to be closer to a city so camping grounds miles away probably are only suitable for weekends. any ideas?

**Showering:**I'm happy to shower less than daily, but probably no more than 3 days. If you live near a beach, does a dip in the beach stop you from smelling too badly? Also, beaches often have free showers to rinse, do these do the trick? 

**Mail:** I suspect that this kind of lifestyle doesnt generate too much mail, but for basic things, do you use friends or families addresses, PO boxes?

**Freshening up:** I don't want to hide away from the world completely so, from time to time ill need to use a proper bathroom, iron up some clothes, etc. to make myself presentable. I don't have that many friends. I'm thinking casual pass at a gym is the only real solution? Any others?

**Ive not considered the following, do I need to? :**

Maintenance and Fuel**:** The van is just 4 walls to put a matress in. I will move it as little as I need to. I have a bike which ill use to get around.

VanLife,"Hi, I'm a software engineer and recently CS teacher. For many years now I have been looking at the pros and cons of living in a van. I'm as close as I ever got to make the move but my reflexion is halted at the moment by a very specific bump in the road ; long-term financial investment.

I wouldn't want to compare the choice of going vanlife with buying and living in a house or a condo, but I want to make sense of the financial aspect that is often brought as an argument in favor of doing the former. Financial freedom is a great goal that living in a van will help you achieve. I'm all for that, but what I'm concerned about is the financial aftermath.

When you buy a house for exemple, apart from coming with all it's related pros and cons, the deal is that you buy something that will not devaluate, that will gain value. It's a long-term investment. When you buy a van, well, it's a vehicule, and vehicules devaluate. So you ultimatly end up with less value than you paid for and you will come back to square one money-wise eventualy.

For context, I'm looking at buying a van at around the 35-45k $ mark. At that price point, I wont have anything new, probably between 150k and 250k km on the counter of the vehicule too. I'm looking for already converted van/campers as I wouldn't have the ressources to do the conversion myself. I live in east canada and I need something that's 4 seasons insulated, that influences the cost, too.

So my question to the ones that did the move is; How do you treat, long-term financially speaking, the action of buying a van with the intent of living in it?

The life style, it's bads and its goods does appeal to me. I however would appreaciate an experienced point of view as to how and why it is financially not as bad as buying something that will eventualy dries out in value looks like to be from the exterior in order to be more confident about such a leap.

Hey guys, first time poster

I have a 1991 Toyota Previa. She's in great condition on the inside, but there are a few problems. I'm still learning how to do maintenance as this is my first vehicle to work on aside from changing oil in my last. I know this is a big bite to start with, but it's the only vehicle I have and no contacts so help would be very welcome.

The problems:

The transmission is buggered and slips out of park when I initially go to move gears, but it sticks once I get it there

The E-break just doesn't work and when it's cold the handle leans up

Grinding noise mainly in the right wheel when braking and also when making sharp turns but only grinding when turning slowly

The radio is out

The AC is also out, but it works when it's warm

The power steering belt needs replacement

The tires need to be balanced


So - my challenge is that I need to replace the brake pads and probably the calipers as well.

Firstly, I am still doing research into replacement but I want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing. What type of tools should I anticipate to use? Is there something I won't be able to do outside of a shop/special tool that is too expensive that regular degular people can't afford?

What should I be looking for when I replace the pads? Such as underlying problems, other things I can check while I'm there.

Keep in mind this is early in my research, so if the questions come off uneducated its because they are! Thank you!

VanLife,"Hello!

My wife, two dogs, and I are about to move into our 1977 VW Camper full time. I am looking at installing a small toilet (preferably a Thetford Porta Potti 335), however, the toilet sits at 12.2"" tall and the only space I have to install a toilet is 12"" tall.  The secondary concern is that the handle to flush the contents into the cassette is mounted on the front of the toilet. This would be blocked by the front of the couch that this would be mounted in. As a result, I'd like to  built a very short wooden box for the top half of the toilet to sit on. The chute from the bowl would then connect to a pipe that directly drops to a holding tank under the bus. All toilets that I've seen that connect directly to a waste holding tank are too tall to fit in the space I have. Thetford's customer support was unable to tell me two bits of information that I'm hoping the folks out here in Redditland can.

First, what is the diameter of the chute?

Second, how far does the chute extend? (Is there enough pipe there to get a coupler on?)

Perhaps, if further explanation is needed, I'd like to connect the top half of this toilet to a short length of pipe via a rubber coupler like this:

https://preview.redd.it/wo971l6jl0161.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd3688e0f3471ac2a8c71efa8011bf3f6f24bd0

Then, the short 3"" pipe would connect to a waste gate mounted horizontally (to separate the bowl from the tank). Basically, the short pipe would act as a second coupler to the ""flushing mechanism"".  This waste gate would have two 3"" pipe fittings rather than a hose fitting. Additionally, the waste gate would be mounted in such a way that the handle would be used from the side rather than from the front. This would look like this:

From there, it connects to another short 3"" pipe that goes through the floor of the bus and drops into a waste holding tank that can be drained from the outside.

# HUGE VAN 24v electric question /advice...

üì∑ [Builds](https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Builds%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

Hey guys,

Just  starting to do the research on my next van build and ive got an idea of  setup but wanted to get some advice on anything to check/look out for.  Also maybe my research will help others looking for similar.

\-The van will be a huge MAN TGE Supersingle (XLWB XHR L4/H4)

\-I want to go gas free

\-I'm  looking at a 24v set up because I've got a few power hungry  appplicances, (aircon, fridge freezer, invertor cooktop) plus other 24v  benefits (weight, cost, less copper usage)

\-I'm going for Lithium Batteries and plenty of solar

I've speaking to a very helpful guy at Photonic Universe in the UK and my plan is:

\-  Iconica All in One Unit ( Iconica 3000W 24V pure sine wave inverter  with zero transfer, 1500W solar input, 60A MPPT solar controller, 60A  mains charger ) ( [https://www.photonicuniverse.com/en/catalog/full/450-Iconica-3000W-24V-pure-sine-wave-inverter-with-zero-transfer-1500W-solar-input-60A-MPPT-solar-controller-60A-mains-charger-parallel-capability-and-Bluetooth-No-Battery-Required.html](https://www.photonicuniverse.com/en/catalog/full/450-Iconica-3000W-24V-pure-sine-wave-inverter-with-zero-transfer-1500W-solar-input-60A-MPPT-solar-controller-60A-mains-charger-parallel-capability-and-Bluetooth-No-Battery-Required.html) )

\-  Solar Panels Semi Flex - (160W black reinforced semi-flexible solar  panel with a durable ETFE coating ) or will get rigid alternative  depending on the plan for the roof ( [https://www.photonicuniverse.com/en/catalog/full/553-160W-black-reinforced-semi-flexible-solar-panel-with-a-durable-ETFE-coating-German-solar-cells.html](https://www.photonicuniverse.com/en/catalog/full/553-160W-black-reinforced-semi-flexible-solar-panel-with-a-durable-ETFE-coating-German-solar-cells.html) )

\- 2 x Pylontech UP2500 24v Lithium Batteries ( [http://en.pylontech.com.cn/pro\_detail.aspx?id=124&amp;cid=23](http://en.pylontech.com.cn/pro_detail.aspx?id=124&amp;cid=23) ) that work with the Iconica system.

As  a rough guide I can get the Iconica unit, 720wh solar and 500ah  Batteries for ¬£3,800. This is a whole heap cheaper than almost any other  setup, especially the Victron options. (They have one 200ah battery for  ¬£2k alone). It's also super easy to stack the batteries if I want to  add another.

My questions are :

**- Best way to use Modern Euro Engine alternator to charge 24v lithium batteries?**

**- Best way to step down 24v to 12v for some 12v appliances like Max Air Fan**

**- What else do I need to think about coming from a 12v setup in current van?**

Also if anyone wanted to know why we are going for such a huge van:

\- Full year round off grid living (from Summers in Greece to Winters in the Alps)

\-  Toy list - 2 x MTB, 1 x small motorbike (Triton Manix 125), 2 x ski  touring kit, 2 x inflatable SUPs, hiking gear, camping gear

\- Inside plan - Rear -  Permanent bed at the back above garage.

\-  Inside plan - Left side - Permanent shower with composting toilet and  'drying room' functionality (heater inlet and the bottom, fan at the  top) - Sink and bit of worktop - sliding door

\-  Inside plan - Right side - Full height slimline fridge freezer -  Induction cooktop and bit of worktop - Small pull out sofa chair bed  thing depending on space and swivel table/counter top

\- Inside plan - Front - Two swivel chairs

This  puts us way above the 3.5t limit, and the MAN TGE Supersingle is rated  to 5t but built using a single rear wheel, which is what I want, and not  a twin.

I choose 5 years because right now I spend 700$ a month on rent and gas and 5 years is the amount of time I'd need to have living in a Van to save money. 

My budget was $43,000 but after watching Let's Be Use on YouTube I think I might have went to far on the safe side. For the van itself I only wanted to pay 8k but I don't know about cars what so ever. So I don't know if a van is good or bad whenever something is broken or someone says ""only the carburetor is broken everything else is fine!"" So that's my biggest concern picking the wrong van and it breaking down to the point of no repair on the first or second year.

VanLife,"Okay, so this one has been a headache for me. I understand that everywhere I research, 12v fridge is the best option because the power draw is lower. However, I don't understand what I am missing, because that is not what I see. For easy math purposes, let's say we have two identical fridges. Both are 120W, but one operates on 120v while the other on 12v.

Watts/Volts=Amps

Amps is how the battery storages power, meaning, the more amps a device needs, more power will draw from the battery, right?

120/12 = 10Amps

120/120 = 1Amp

I understand that I will need to run an inverter to be able to run the 120V fridge, but the power draw from the inverter doesn't justify going for 12v.

I feel like I am missing something really simple here, so I am sorry if that is a dumb question. I am just trying to understand the electrical system better.",12v and 110v fridge

VanLife,"Hi all. I just purchased a van that is outfitted with a Vanner 20-1050CUL-DC Ambulance Power Module ([link to manual](https://www.vanner.com/manuals/20-1050CUL-DC.pdf)). This is an inverter/charger/transfer relay. As far as I can tell, it only charges from shore power (not from the alternator). The van itself is wired with several additional 12v outlets, and several 120v AC outlets. These only put out power when the vehicle is running.

The charger in that unit is not optimized to charge LifePO4 batteries, which I would like to use. To that end, I have purchased 100aH battery and Renogy DCC50S DC-DC charger.

I would like to be able to run the 12v and 120v outlets (particularly the 12v) when the van is off. Do I just need a battery selector switch like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Perko-8501DP-Marine-Battery-Selector/dp/B00144B6AE)? Is it that simple? Or does the Vanner module make this more complex?

VanLife,"A bit of rambly info for reference: 

I'm nearing 30, single, female, writer, and an office worker (and I like it) and I'm thinking of going van life full time. I sky, play golf, raft, bake, and sew. So far I've worked out most of the logistics and restrictions I'll face when going mini - I'll be trying small sewing machine models, capsule wardrobes, grill ovens for baking, and such so that I can transition all my inside hobbies easily, I've got interior designed, ideal model picked up and all the technical stuff and such worked out as well. If I end up in a relationship in the future and we decide to settle with some real walls and a roof over our heads the van would be a perfect travel vehicle for us so I don't think it's a bad investment long-term. Still, I got some kinda silly questions that I'd really appreciate your two cents on. 

Oh quick addition: I'm really digging the certainty of having a home, my own space, that I won't get kicked out in case of a catastrophe, that I can take anywhere and everywhere and away if I need to, and that I can rely on being there no matter what. I don't need too much space and always liked smaller living spaces anyway. 

**1) Apart from the purchase and building investment, is monthly living in a van cheaper?**   
I'd have sollars + propane, but I'm talking stuff like car maintenance, internet, water, possible parking fees (I'd mostly do free parking during work weeks), and all that stuff. Would you say, from experience, whether it is cheaper to stay in a van or in a regular home? 

**2)** **Bloody frickin laundry. Like how even what even + related problem: bedding**  
I'm a big fan of wool sweaters, so I'm used to doing hand washing. With a small closet, I'll do a lot of regular daily hand washing and drying so that's okay but what I'm really not a big fan of is doing bedding washing - there's only a single laundromat in my city and they're not exactly common in Europe, where I am and will be based, as far I know. Either way, how are ya'll sleeping :D ? Do you have a regular duvet and two covers that you change and wash and dry together when they both get dirty in a laundromat? Are there any alternatives? It's really silly, I know - but... ya know? I'm okay with a sleeping bag but like... why, if it's not necessary? 

**3) The van size**  
Does anyone for the love of all that's good in the world know what's the maximum length of a van to legally park in a regular parking spot? Maybe I'm just not looking well enough but I can't find a definite answer anywhere. 

**4) Fridge and freezer**  
I am doing a regular fridge and freezer bit. Like there's no question about it. I just wonder if anyone who does have a fridge and freezer in their van has any tips or regrets? Is it worth it? 

**5) A bit unrelated but:** does anyone with their steering wheel on the left side (regular Europe) drove in England (or Malta) where you switch sides? Is it manageable? I have a lot of experience driving on the other side but with the steering wheel where it should be.

We're starting our VanLife project and we've got many questions, perhaps you guys might be able to help us out. 

We live in France and we want to hire somebody to build our van from scratch, but we can't decide which van would be the best...  
\- ***Would you be able to advise us on which van model could be a good idea?*** We're looking for a model that is not too old but not brand new, and that we may find it here in Europe (US brands are not so easy to find). Probably a model from the 00's. Also we'd like to be able to park in a regular parking spot (around 5 meters, is it?). Lastly, we need to be able to stand up inside it, so either a van that's high already, or that we may change the roof.

\- ***What would be the maximum length of the van to be able to park in the street?*** We heard it's 5 meters, but plenty of models are around 5,2 meters, so we wonder if somebody out there has experience with vans that are a bit longer in regards to parking in the street.

\- ***Buying a van that has no side windows and later adding one, could it be a bad idea?*** Like, is it very expensive? Or perhaps it's not really advised for some other reason? We mean... is it doable? :P

\- ***Buying a van that is not very high and adding a high-top, could it be a bad idea?*** We know it's possible, but would it add many constraints, like isolation problems, or not being able to park in the majority of private indoor parking lots?

\- ***Do you know anyone (or a company) in France that works with van conversion?*** If yes, how can we contact them? We know it's a bit of a stretch to ask that, but who knows... perhaps we get lucky ;)

Since she‚Äôs so early in the process and has a vision for it (plus we‚Äôre long distance so I don‚Äôt really have anything to do with the renovations, I just get to reap the benefits haha), I‚Äôm not looking for anything like major or structural. 

I‚Äôd love ideas of things that y‚Äôall love in your vans and on the road. Any suggestions are appreciated!",Gift ideas for partner who‚Äôs just starting out on her van renovations!

VanLife,"Van! Life! Tour! After 2 summers, 47 states, 43 national parks, 50,000+ miles, and (roughly) 3,000,000 hours of driving, I can still vouch for the unlimited freedom of van life. Zero planning. Always ready for a new adventure. Park and sleep anywhere. It‚Äôs the actual dream. And one of my favorite ways to travel, especially in 2020.

If you‚Äôre looking for a simple layout for a smaller van or even mini van, I‚Äòve loved this layout! So simple and easy to access everything from the inside or outside of the van. I made a whole van tour so you can see how every bit of space was utilized to the fullest. Next van build I‚Äôll probably do the exact same thing I loved it so much!

Hope the video is helpful and spreads a bit of joy :)",VAN TOUR | DIY Stealth Budget Camper Van | Solo Female Digital Nomad

VanLife,"Hi!  We are purchasing our first GMC Savana 3500 LT and have reached out nth issue.  Who do you use for insurance in the US?  We are in AZ.  American Family says they won't cover it unless the back seats are pulled out by a professional conversion company.  It has to seat less than 12.

Anyone have a favorite professional conversion company near Tucson AZ?  

Favorite insurance?  

Thanks!

VanLife,,Ford Unveils New Electric Van
VanLife,"Looking out the window this evening and the rain is hammering down and I thought to myself - time to plan the next van build!! Sure what else would you be at? In the summer I loved tipping away at the van in the long summer evenings and escaping at the weekends to places I've always wanted to visit but without the accommodation costs and the choice to move freely to different locations!! 

This time it's going to be different though..I've learned my lessons from previous builds and I know exactly what I want for the new van and I want to maximize my budget. So sitting looking out the window I thought right.... instead of binge-watching Netflix and aimlessly scrolling through Facebook, this is where my spare time will go, and come next summer I will thank myself and give myself a pat on the back for making this decision now!!

From my own experience, there is nothing worse than trying to design and plan as you are building.  As the famous saying goes - 

# By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe we can start a planning thread and share ideas of what areas we are honing in on when planning our build. e.g how to save money, where to buy the best quality parts etc.

VanLife,"We are currently converting a 2019 extended Chevy Express Passenger van. It‚Äôs front wheel drive and we are not converting to 4 wheel drive, but would like to make it more capable of taking on grated roads/dirt roads.  We‚Äôre considering changing out the tires and possibly upgrading the suspension as well. Just wondering if anyone has any experience and advice in this department.  All terrain seems like a quitter ride, but are all terrain that much better performance compared to the stock tires? Would we really be better off with off road tires since we only have two wheel drive? Would upgrading the suspension be helpful? She‚Äôs also a BIG lady, since she has an extended cab we don‚Äôt ever plan on taking her anywhere too crazy... also one more consideration is that we are moving to Washington state this year from the desert, so much wetter, potentially more muddy conditions. Thanks in advance! Can‚Äôt wait to post some pictures of our build!",In your experience what type of tires are best? All terrain or off road?
