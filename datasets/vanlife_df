I have a few questions I'm hoping someone can help me with:

So, I'm planning to use the profit of my house sale to fund some/all of my van build. My understanding regarding real estate taxes are concerned is that if I were to invest the money from my house sale into another brick and mortar/stationary/typical house I wouldn't need to pay taxes on that money (as long as the new house is my primary residence.) Assuming that's correct (and maybe its not?) does the same apply to the purchase of a house on wheels - if it intended to be my full-time/primary home? Something tells me the man won't see it that way, but is there an accountant (or anyone) out there who knows anything about this, can give me a little guidance? (I was planning to use a friend's house as my mailing address, but I'm guessing I'm going to need to establish a permanent residence with my home on wheels, somehow? Yikes.

Also, regarding financing for van builds. The money from my home sale may not be available in time to start the van build - trying to avoid too much time between the sale of me house and the completion of my van. If I don't have the cash to pay for everything, and I need to secure financing is there anyone who gave give me some pointers and/or recommendations on how to find a lender who would be willing to get creative with the financing? (For example, could I maybe finance the vehicle as a regular car loan separate from the build, and get a personal loan or something to pay for the build (maybe using my house as collateral?) and then merge them together in a single class B motorhome loan once the van is complete?)

We both currently work for a work at home call center where the only requirement is 100% reliable ethernet internet. Also, we both have to work in two seperate rooms as it needs to be silent. 

So we could possibly have one of us work as the call center agent which means the other would need to listen to them all day in this tiny space, also, we imagine the dog might bark on occasion since vans aren't quiet.

3. Toilet, shower, kitchen preferred, but not absolutely needed

VanLife,"So, I (25F) have been considering van life for a little while now, for a bunch of reasons: I love traveling, I am allergic to monotony, staying in one place long term stresses me out, financials, etc). I can easily live with a small amount of belongings, and I live for adventure. 

That being said, as of right now, I have an ‚Äò08 Subaru Legacy with a lot of miles on it. The backseats fold down, but it‚Äôs a small car. Plus, I often worry of breakdowns and expensive repairs. I have AAA, but driving a car with over 200k miles is still pretty risky. It had a lot of issues when I bought it, which I‚Äôve since fixed, but it‚Äôs still worrisome. 

So, that brings me to my main question. I‚Äôve been going back and forth between purchasing a cargo van (such as a Ford Econoline or Chevy Express) or a slightly newer Subaru Outback. I don‚Äôt have a terribly large budget (I‚Äôm looking in the $4,000-$10,000 range), and I plan on calling this vehicle my home, so I‚Äôd need to build it up a bit. I know vans can have sub-par gas milage, and their size is a bit intimidating. Obviously, the amount of space puts them at an advantage over SUVs, but I‚Äôm not totally sure of the long-run cost. 

Some things to keep in mind:
1. I am only 5‚Äô2, so putting a bed sideways will help with space
2. It‚Äôs just me, no significant other
3. I can get carsick when driving certain vehicles, but I‚Äôve personally never driven either type of car
4. I plan on storing my laptop and camera, so security and temperature are things on my mind
5. I‚Äôm not used to driving large vehicles (I once tried to drive a Dodge Grand Caravan on a highway and it was a nightmare), but I‚Äôve driven a UHaul and it was only mildly terrifying. It might just be something to get used to?
6. I plan on chasing warmer weather, so I don‚Äôt anticipate any freezing nights. Of course, they can happen, so obviously I‚Äôd have to be prepared.
7. As of right now, I‚Äôm figuring out plans for making money. I have a good video camera and equipment, so I might try my hand at youtube, but obviously I can‚Äôt rely on that, so any ideas would be appreciated. I have a Bachelors Degree in Creative Writing and I currently work with Doordash and as a restaurant hostess. 

I‚Äôd LOVE to get some insight and advice. I‚Äôve been researching heavily, but nothing is as good as personal comments directed to my specific situation. I recently moved back in with my mom and sister in New Jersey and I am super ready to get out within this year. I need to wake up by some mountains.

Tl;dr: I want to live in a vehicle, but not sure if I should spring for a big cargo van (which might be hard to drive/not as good gas milage/etc) or an SUV (less space, but easier).",Cargo Van or SUV?,1,False,valbuquerque

My question is...does anyone have any idea of what the cost might be to have a manual van converted to be a completely automatic transmission? Including the gear box, auto stick and the conversion to only two pedals. 

It might make it easier to choose a great van with the much larger selection if this is financially viable.

Ideally I want a small, low profile vent on the roof that I can open/ close to control the airflow and let in some light. I'm not trying to stealth camp really, but I'd feel a lot better about having a vent on the roof that I could leave open at night, rather than the windows that someone could pretty easily notice are open.

I'm not sure about paying upwards of ¬£70 for something that may not be necessary, though, especially since the van is so small - most of the roof vents seem like overkill in a tiny van.

I was wondering if there's something similar to a mushroom vent that I could install, but which I could open/ close, since I don't want a constant outlet to the cold air outside (I'm in the UK, so it's cold more often than not). I recognise that wouldn't let in any light, but that's not a huge deal breaker.

Alternately, I guess I could try fitting a louvre vent on the side of the van and hooking up a small fan to help with air intake/ extraction, but I'm nervous about cutting holes in the van as it is. I feel like it'll be easier to hide any mistakes on the top of the van, rather than right there on the side!

VanLife,"So I was going to build something else but decided a bus would be better and look far more attractive as well. They are both 35' buses but I cannot decide between the flat nose and the dog nose. For this instance I am leaning towards the dog nose because it is in better shape and the groundwork is already laid for my conversion. They are both the same price.

**Uses For Build:**  
So this is going to be a full time living thing. At the end of the month my lease is up and I want to at least have this be sleep-able within about 10 days which is doable on either build but the dog nose will be faster. I also want this to be a 100% boondocking rig that can operate off grid. I can park this rig at work during the work week as well but cannot connect to shore power.

Do you have anything to add here or any comments? I am leaning one way but I want to make sure I make the best decision.

# Dog nose FE:

**Pros:**

* Interior is already stripped with interior paint and flooring done
* Exterior is also primed and ready for me to paint it.
* I will have the ability to maintain the vehicle myself by just popping the hood.
* Ability to build garage in the back since it has that big door
* Easy to hear how the engine is running

**Cons:**

* Less interior space at the same overall length
* Can't hide that is used to be a bus for RV parks although I have no interest in RV parks
* Less traction in snow although this may not be an issue after I build out my water tanks in the back

&amp;#x200B;

# Flat Nose RE:

**Pros:**

* More interior space
* More traction
* Less noise when driving
* Could blend more at RV parks even though I don't want to go to RV parks

**Cons:**

* Hard to hear how the engine is running
* Cannot build garage
* Super low to the ground
* Has airbag suspension (less reliable than leaf springs)
* It is a bus inside so I will need to scrap everything and then do all the pain and flooring

I‚Äôm going to start my van build in April, and I‚Äôm planning what I‚Äôll need to buy, but I‚Äôm very confused about power and certain electric appliances.

Do you know of any appliances like water kettles or induction cooktops that will definitely work with it?

VanLife,"Howdy folks. 

Just wondering if anyone has experience converting a transit crew cab (1 row of seats) into a camper build. I am getting ready to pull the trigger and order an AWD high roof extended, but I am getting hung up on spending the few extra grand for the second row of seats.

I want the second row for friends and further down the line when I may have a kid I want to bring along. Having airbags and seat mounts from the factory seem like a no brainer for this. However I have a couple concerns:

1. Insulation. I live on northern alberta and mostly use my current van for skiing. Lots of time will be spent in -10C and all the way down to -35C is nothing out of the ordinary. Because of the airbags 1/2 finished interior on the floor, walls, and roof I dont think it would be practical to install any insulation in the front section. 

Does anyone have experience insulating only the rear half of their van? Did you get uncomfortable at a certain point? Would prefer not to have to run the heater at all times because of thermal losses 

2. Does anyone have experience with retrofitting a different seat? The stock seat looks like it would make getting into the back with the doors closed a major PITA. I saw that you can get a shorter 36""/37"" seat from the passenger models that will fit in that spot, but that is ANOTHER 500 bucks if I can even find one used. Has anyone done this?

3. Would you trust an aftermarket seat install with the life of your child (lol)? I have been getting mixed reviews about adding a seat later and how safe this option really is. It would be a nice solution to my problem though to just get the cargo model and install a single seat where it fits best when the time comes and I actually NEED it.

VanLife,"Hey,

So yeah long story short, started in a hatchback a long time ago..  Upgraded to a van last year but I'm thinking about going back down to a car.  Here's my thoughts:

Because I work for GM, I can get a new vehicle at staff price.  A base model Chevy spark is $11,700 for a manual transmission.  Staff price would be discounted off that so I could probably still  get a 2020 for like ten grand.  

I really, *really* love this car.  I've driven them around and they're fun.  Not a lot of power, it's basically a golf cart but I don't care.  The reason why I love it is because it's low tech; manual windows, manual door locks, manual mirrors.  It has cruise control, a small infotainment system with the mandatory back up camera and that's it.  No fancy electronics to fail outside of warranty.

Compare that with my 2007 van.  It's only 13 years old but already lots of problems.  Power door locks have failed, had to fix that.  Power window failed, had to fix that as well.  Coolant leaks.  Gasket leaks.  Yes I get staff price on parts because I work for them but still....it sucks.  The maintenance is getting to me.

So heres the obvious pros and cons.

The van has way more space of course.  I built a bed in the back and it fits behind where the seat was (I took out the passenger seat).  I can almost stand up inside.  So yeah,  roomy.

HOWEVER

The cons are this: Gas mileage suuuuucks. When I had my little car I was getting 40 mpg on the highway.  I could fill it up for $25 and drive for two weeks.  The van loves the juice !  With one of these new cars, I can still get 38 mpg highway with the 5 speed.  

PLUS

With a brand new car I get warranty.  If anything shits the bed it'll most likely be covered.  And like I said I work for GM so I can get cheaper parts cost.

Now the obvious con against the car:

The lack of space.  I'd already be pulling out all of the seats (spare me the comments about tearing apart a brand new car) and would need to build the sleeping area where the existing passenger seat is.  I'd need to build windows coverings to seal up the front against looky-loos peering inside my car while I'm sleeping.  I'd barely have enough space behind the driver's seat for a little shelf for clothing etc.

But even with the massive lack of space, when I had my car I just felt more..

Free?  It *felt better*.  I actually miss my little car.  I miss paying &lt;$30 for a tank of gas.  Other things like stealth, food &amp; climate don't really bother me; I work a second job in a restaurant nights/weekends &amp; I eat for free every morning at a local church.  My food costs are nearly zero.  I basically only use my van for sleeping and storage anyway.  I live in a climate where it doesn't get too cold in winter so I don't need to worry about snow or freezing to death.   Heating a smaller space is actually easier than trying to heat a huge van.

ALSO

Insurance would be negligible.  By law here you'd have to have full comprehensive IF you finance;. However because I'd just pay it in full (it's only $10k) I don't need full insurance because I'm not in debt to a creditor.  I'd only get basic and maybe fire, theft &amp; windows.  My current van insurance is only $634/year and my car was only $1/month more than the van!

I'm just so torn on this.  Yeah I like the added space but I've also noticed I'm starting to collect more shit because I have the space.  I cleaned out the van today and I was like ""where the F did all this come from?"". I consider myself a minimalist; I've lived out of a backpack for years and have traveled the world on next to nothing.  Like I said, because I won't be cooking in the vehicle, I just need a spot to lay my head and store some clothes. I do everything else that all of us vanlifers do: gym for showers, I also do have a storage unit $49/month for keepsakes, mementos, some stuff I really don't use often like twice a year etc.  So if I do need anything I can just grab it from my unit.

Maybe in various conditions (ie. winter vs summer). Feel like it impossible to make actual solar panel decisions based on how much you use and then getting the appropriate battery/solar to match. For example if I live in the PNW, I might go for a propane burner over an induction if filling the battery bank is not feasible through solar.

VanLife,"Hi everyone! For the past week I've been going hard on studying everything I can about a campervan electrical system, and I've learned tons. I still have a fair ways to go and thought I would ask some questions here, for my benefit as well as for any others who would have the same questions.

I'll be doing my best to fill out the answers to these questions myself as I continue to learn, so if there's a question on this post that hasn't been answered that you'd like to know the answer to, save the post and check back periodically, as I'll be updating.

I'll post some great resources I've found too, at the end of the post.

Some of these questions are pretty simple and I'll report back soon with what I can dig up!

Questions - 

1. In terms of a solar panel setup, is it critical to buy a panel that has a lower VoC rating than the voltage that a solar charge controller is rated for? For example, if I have a 300w solar panel, that has a VoC of, say, 40V, would you then *need* a solar charge controller with a voltage rating of 50 or higher? I'm assuming yes, but I thought, why not ask. 

2. Is it possible to charge a nominal 12v battery with a 24v solar panel? If yes, is it the charge controller that's allowing this?

3. What does everybody recommend for wiring both your battery bank and panel array in regards to series vs. parallel? 

    I understand that, when an array is wired in parallel, partial shading becomes slightly less of an issue (it's a big issue for series connections), and that parallel isn't good for when you have a decently long run from your panels to your batteries, because of the resistance within long wires. I would be inclined to wire my panels in parallel, as I don't have a long run, and the effects of partial shading is reduced, but would you not also gain more charge to your batteries because of the increased current? 

4. This question kind of relates to the last one, about series vs. parallel.

    Would a series connection charge the battery for more time out of the day, due to more volts being squeezed out of the sun, due to the series connection? (Series -&gt; double voltage)

    Here's how I understand it (probably wrongly), In order to reverse the chemical reactions in the battery and get it to charge, you must supply a voltage that's greater (but not too much greater!) than the nominal voltage rating of the battery, usually 12v. And from what I understand, the supplied voltage can't dip below the nominal value, the battery won't charge on any lesser voltage. So would it stand to reason that an array wired in series could supply more voltage for longer, therefore charging the battery more? 

    The answer to this one seems pretty elusive, as some people have their panels wired in parallel, and others in series. Which I guess makes it somewhat of a preference. I just, like, don't know, man.

5. In regards to wire sizes, what would be stopping someone, besides the cost, from using huge diameter wires for everything? Would this be dangerous in some way?

6. This ones pretty dumb, but the charge controller is what handles the charge profile of the battery, right? And how would a BMS interact with a solar charge controller? I should be able to find this one on my own.

7. I've heard that certain types of new lithium battery tech can allow for a connection between batteries of different sizes and ages. Is this true? 

8. Another easy one: Fuse sizing. How do? Should be pretty simple.

VanLife,"I have the ball rolling to trade my car in for a 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan ($15k CAD, 64k km), which I intend to make into a camper. My immediate motivation for this is that I live on an island (ferry access to mainland), and I want to be able to drive over to the mainland during the week for work, and not have to pay for a hotel. I would also love to be able to go camping, and to drive further across the country for adventure and more work options (I work in the film industry).

Minivan is easier to get used to driving, coming from a car. It's cheap to maintain and repair, and has good fuel economy.

But I have a dream of moving out of my shared apartment and living in a van full time, and I don't know if I'll regret not getting a larger vehicle now. If I got a cargo van or a sprinter, for that price, I would have to get something older with more km. And it would have worse fuel economy and be more expensive to maintain and repair.

I already live pretty minimally, but I don't think I could make the Caravan work for me for full time living, mostly because I have two guitars (acoustic and electric).

So I think my options are:

1. Buy the Caravan, keep renting my apartment bedroom, use van for mainland work and camping. Don't make permanent changes to the van, so I can sell it if I decide to upgrade. (and if I end up living in it, I could always sell my guitars and get a small traveller acoustic/electric combo)
2. Buy an older cargo van now, and eat the initial additional cost of fuel (and possibly high maintenance and repair bills right out the gate), to get more space and have a viable live-in situation right off the bat.

VanLife,"I am considering buying myself a travel trailer to live in full time. I already have a vehicle that should be able to tow, so that is why I don't want to go in the direction of a van, and I don't need the stealthiness a van provides either.

I was hoping to find some ""TrailerLife"" folks, but /r/VanLife was the closest I found.

The vehicle I would be towing with is a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk with tow package. The manufacture says this allows me 4,500 lbs of tow capacity. Without the tow package the Cherokee normally tows 2,000 lbs. I am curious, what actually offers the extra 2,500 lbs of capacity, and should I give myself breathing room between the GVW of the trailer and the towing capacity?

I was looking at getting something like the TAB 400 Solo, a teardrop trailer, which has a ""Total Gross Weight (Dry)"" of 2,876 lbs, and a ""GAWR"" of 3,900 lbs (is this the same or similar to GVWR?) Since these numbers are below the 4,500 lb tow capacity of my vehicle, this means my vehicle should be fine towing this trailer, correct?

Another thing I was looking at was the price of the TAB 400 Solo is a bit up there, and I just want to make sure I know what I am getting for my money.

I saw a regular trailer ([https://coachmenrv.com/travel-trailers/apex-nano](https://coachmenrv.com/travel-trailers/apex-nano)), for almost half the price, with similar weight, but more volume inside the trailer. Larger bathroom, etc. However, the TAB 400 Solo, looks like it comes a bit more feature packed with solar panels and such.

It's a bit overwhelming looking at this stuff since I am not super familiar with trailers, so hoping to meet people who could share some of their experience. Especially on safety regarding towing with my vehicle, and on what I should look out for when buying a trailer.

VanLife,"I'm still planning my build, and I wanted to ask around if anyone has thoughts about an idea I'm toying with. While I'm sure that everyone knows Dometic, ARB, etc. make excellent fridges, it's also beyond doubt that they are expensive. Apart from their price they also share another quality, efficiency, as compared to mini-fridges and the like which bleed the sinking cold air like mad when the door is opened. Chest-style fridges like Dometic don't have this problem because they retain the cold air inside their body, thus requiring less electricity for cooling. So what about using a chest freezer?

A 3.5 cubic foot chest freezer is less than $200, extremely well insulated, and when coupled with a cheap inverter and an in-line thermostat it could be the ultimate combination of low-cost and high-efficiency. In my case, I already own a dedicated inverter for the project as well as an Inkbird thermostat to adjust from freezing to regular refrigeration temperatures. I'd be putting this setup in a 2002 Ford E-250, so space is somewhat limited of course--but I think I could pull it off. Barring anything I haven't thought of, it should cost around $200.

VanLife,"Hi Everyone, 

I‚Äôve been building my van for two months. I bought it on December 5th. Am using the FarOutRide layout for a high powered system, and I have a domestic brisk 2 on the roof. I have an older Cobra 3000 watt peak modified sine wave inverter which obviously doesn‚Äôt cut it, in spite of a soft smart capacitor.

Yesterday I installed a Victron Multiplus 3000 watt inverter/charger (which is AWESOME), however my house batteries drained very quickly. They are two new big Duracell deep cell batteries for RVs, and when I woke up this morning the house batteries were almost dead. I wired it with 2 awg stranded wire to the bus bars and one A/C output to a triple plug, which measures 120ac on all three plugs. 

Additionally, when I ran a second AC output to the 20amp AC breaker for the domestic brisk, it read 87 volts with the breaker off and with the breaker on only mV on both sides. So I took that out and wired a grounded plug and plugged it in to the triple plug, and it did run the fan on the air conditioner, and it ran the cold ac, but indicated the house battery was low and then quickly became too low. Before this my house batteries have never gone below 60%. 

What‚Äôs even more confusing is the house batteries did not charge while I left the vehicle running for a couple hours, and the 12v charging solenoid has never been a problem previously.

The long and the short of it is when I installed the Victron Inverter Charger my house batteries went dead. The only potential cause I can identify is I did not ground the Victron box itself. The inverter was also flat on its back instead of mounted upright. There are no loose grounds of which I‚Äôm aware.

Of note - I had left the headlights on the night before and used my 120v AC battery charger and quick start to get the truck running. Three quick starts and 15 minutes of charging (while plugged into the house batteries) got the van started.

I'm creating a database of all types of cars suitable for car camping, especially the smaller ones - MPVs, estates, SUVs that are long enough.

Hello,

I know this is a stretch as nothing is yet defined, but in terms of car, model, sizes, lifestyle, maintenance, investment..I've 3 vehicles under my radar, and they are available around me.

LT28: found one for 6000‚Ç¨, renovated in welding, insulation, and flooring, with solar panel, kitchen, water tank, gas tank..

T3: did not find one yet, but I like it's more compact than the LT28 but with high roof I could still stand in it

L400: very cheap, totally empty inside, I could spend the remaining money in making it mine, but I'll end up having something where I can barely fit myself + dog and I can never stand up.

&amp;#x200B;

I will travel..sometimes for a weekend, but one day for 6/12 months. It will be me, my dog, maybe a partner, and that's it. Of course would be nice to go on weekends with friends, but it will happen 1/2 a year. I‚Äôd surely like to have a car that I can use for the next 5+ years (unless I want to sell it for something else) and travel from weekend trips to long far away journeys in the middle of nowhere :)

  
I love the LT28 just because it's big, its a classic, very easy to resell, quite cheap for what I'll get I think, it allows me to create a house inside..  
I'm just afraid it's too big, too heavy, lots of consumption, constant work in progress..

The T3 with high top I think is the great sized camper, but I do not find many and the ones I can afford are the same price of the LT28...not sure if in being compact it's a good investment or not?! Considering the LT28 and the L400 I feel the T3 has best and worst of both worlds, and doesn‚Äôt really leaves you with a strong reason on choosing this but maybe I don‚Äôt see it right!? 

The L400 I love that is 4x4 and that is so compact - nobody would know you're sleeping in there - and that it's newer, more reliable, cheaper, faster...it's closer to a proper car rather than a old heavy van. Also can be put in a garage for safety while the other two are too big for standard garages. And this I think it‚Äôs easier/cheaper to load on boats.

&amp;#x200B;

This is really the super summary of what I think in terms of pros and cons, but I'd LOVE if I could hear your opinions. I want to choose by the end of this week as I've different cars lined up but I want to organize meetings with the ones I really think is right to go for..and I know it depends by the state of the car, but I also want to push and look out for my type of vehicle.

VanLife,"  

This is my first time working with electric, off grid, solar, everything ‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at (and humbly looking for guidance).

Just bought a ‚Äô95 Chevy G30 15-psgr van (used as a nursing home transport van), with a hightop and only 60,000 original miles. Converting to a DIY budget campervan, but we‚Äôre only planning on using it for vacations: maybe one weekend/month, and two 2-3 week trips each year, so like 50-60 days per year. When we are on these trips, we will probably be driving an average of 2-3 hours/day. We are NOT living in it, so we are only looking to install a minimal to moderate solar system that can power:

2 laptops, 1 iPad, 2 cell phones, 1 hot spot, 1 cellular booster, LED lights, MaxxFan Deluxe ‚Ä¶ AND

110V Freezer Chest!

I know that there is a lot of debate about the pros/cons of doing a freezer chest conversion vs. 12V DC fridge. When we go camping, we drink a lot of adult beverages . . . we‚Äôre on vacation. This seems like to cheapest way to get a big fridge that will keep those drinks cold. And it sounds like the power usage can be comparable or less than a 12V fridge, as long as I don‚Äôt have the inverter running 24/7. 

The system I have designed is basically built from the starting point of getting this freezer and figuring out how to power it without keeping an inverter on all day.

[https://www.homedepot.com/p/Koolatron-Kool-3-5-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-KTCF99/301097784](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Koolatron-Kool-3-5-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-KTCF99/301097784)

[https://www.koolatron.com/CA/en/white-chest-freezer-99l](https://www.koolatron.com/CA/en/white-chest-freezer-99l)

Importantly, this particular freezer has a thermostat that can go up to 32 degrees, so we‚Äôre thinking that drinks and any non-produce food can stay cold, without freezing too much. If that doesn‚Äôt work, and it is too cold, we will try and manually alter the thermostat like the home brewers suggest:

[https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/guide-to-set-internal-chest-freezer-thermostat-to-32f-eliminate-external-control.249612/](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/guide-to-set-internal-chest-freezer-thermostat-to-32f-eliminate-external-control.249612/)

If either of these methods work, I would not need an external thermostat to regulate the freezer temp: it will either be factory set at 32, or I will manually adjust that upwards, closer to 40. 

Because the fridge will be plugged into an inverter all day, I looked for an inverter with a Power Save mode, so that it will only turn on when there is a draw. GoPower inverters have that option:

‚ÄúPower saving mode enables the inverter to turn itself on and off looking for a specific sized load, yet draw less power than standard operation. When power saving is enabled and the inverter senses a load, it may take one second for the load to become active. This one-second wait will be fine for loads that draw continually, such as televisions and stereos. However, it may not be suitable for loads that are intermittent such as bread makers, power tools or blenders. Power saving will continually draw a small amount of power from the batteries, so if the inverter will not be in use for longer than a day, it is advisable to turn the inverter off using the on/off switch located on the front of the inverter or remote.‚Äù

[https://gpelectric.com/products/1500-watt-industrial-pure-sine-wave-inverter/](https://gpelectric.com/products/1500-watt-industrial-pure-sine-wave-inverter/)

[https://gpelectric.com/products/gp-sw1500-ts/](https://gpelectric.com/products/gp-sw1500-ts/)

My hope is that when the fridge thermostat goes to turn the compressor on, it will wake the inverter up to provide power. This should only happen a couple of times an hour, and should only run for a few minutes each time. 

Another option, would be to follow this poster‚Äôs advice, he used a few more components to be able to basically do the same thing‚Äîautomatically turn the inverter on, only when the thermostat turns on:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/4efrgd/creating\_an\_effective\_and\_ultraefficient/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/4efrgd/creating_an_effective_and_ultraefficient/)

So, with the freezer chest conversion as my starting point, I need an inverter that will only turn on when the compressor turns on. After that, I am just trying to install the most cost-effective and efficient components for the rest of my system. I thought we could try to get by with 200W solar and 100Ah lithium. But, I want to make sure that my components can support an expansion to 400W solar and 200Ah, if it turns out that we need more power. Here is where I am at:

VanLife,"I've been following vanlife stuff for a while, thinking about some sort of sprinter post retirement for myself.  That is my main goal in the subreddit.  I'm kind of on hold with that while prices are ridic.

But we have a family situation.  My mother in law has had a rough life.  Lots of addiction, poor health as a result, awful finances as a result.  We have been housing her temporarily in a family home but as probate comes to a close we cannot afford to hold it and let her stay completely free anymore.  She lives 700 miles from us and refuses to move closer. We have a few months to figure something out for her.  The estate also has an older motorhome- 1977.  She expressed interest in it but I took a closer look and it is totally hammered.  Mice, no plumbing, missing siding etc.  It isn't a project she is capable of taking on.  And from a distance it isn't a project I can take on.

&amp;#x200B;

Wife mentioned buying her a better motorhome to live in $5,000-10,000 price range.  We would title it to her.  She gets enough alimony, social security and public assistance to insure it and probably pay to park it most of the time.  We are financially stable.  Maybe more than stable.  But MIL is capable of consuming infinite time and resources.  We want to help her with a living situation without being a bottomless handout.  We offered her a semi-permanent apartment that we own in our home town- and a job- but she will not move- or work.    

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a horrible idea?  How expensive is FT RV life in a 1990's era modest size unit?  can she scrape by on $600 a month if insurance is covered?

&amp;#x200B;

additional details:

She lives in the southwest, warm, dry desert climate.

She can drive and has owned a car pretty continuously.

She has enough family and 'friends' that she can probably bounce driveway to driveway 75% of the time.  She also has some family land out in the desert she can fall back on frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns:

She isn't the greatest driver and a motorhome is hard to drive.

   Age of model isn‚Äôt an issue but I‚Äôd prefer something recent enough that I won‚Äôt have a hard time trying to find parts to fix it if necessary. I‚Äôm not interested in the ginormous cargo or delivery truck type vans, I prefer something compact but still large enough to not be suffocating. I‚Äôm pretty short at 5‚Äô6 and I‚Äôd like to be able to stand up in my van, so I wonder whether or not a high top is necessary? In regards to the actual conversion I know heat and insulation are something I need, but I‚Äôd like to know what is a requirement for survival and what I can possible do without, ie a generator vs a solar panel, a hot plate vs a kitchen etc.

   In summary, I guess I‚Äôm wondering what would be the most economical van to buy and convert, with only the basic essentials for survival and relative comfort on the road, without being too large or extravagant. Also I‚Äôd prefer something with some color as opposed to the standard plain white van but that‚Äôs a minor issue in the grand scheme of things. There‚Äôs no rush, as I‚Äôm not planning on starting my trip till I graduate so I have time to slowly convert it these next few years. If anyone has any suggestions or advice I‚Äôd really appreciate it.","Interested in van life, unsure on how to get started?",3,False,Will-Upvote-For-Food

It's listed on google maps, there's a couple sparse entries about it if you search for it.

There's two reviews on the google listing and they're fairly recent, saying it's an awesome spot, but that's about all there is. It looks like an incredible location. It shows up on google earth satellite and you can see a little path leading to what looks like could be a campground? This is the place on google earth.

I feel like my current life has too many limitations. I'm not able to sleep whenever I want, I'm not able to rest whenever I want, I'm not able to make music when I want, I'm not able to work whenever I want etc. Therefore, I'm leaving my house and want to live on the streets. (40 hours work every week, is not worth the comfort of owning a house). I want to make money by playing music on the streets. (10/20 euro a day would be enough for me haha).

I've build an electric mountainboard which runs on 36v, 800w. I want to attach a (2 meter x 1.4 meter, carbon fiber) trailer to it.

I want to run the mountainboard on 3 car batteries in series.

Since you can't discharge and charge batteries at the same time with solar (right?), I was thinking of getting 6 car batteries in total. This way I can charge 3 batteries (with solar panels) while I discharge the other 3 (while cruising).

A single car battery is 12v and 42ah (and only 25 euro, new, a piece).

I want to keep things as cheap as possible, so 18650 batteries might not be not be an option.

I'm hoping someone here has the knowledge regarding solar panels and is able to help me with chasing my dream-life.

I'm aiming for 15h\~ solar charge time. (for charging 3x12v 42ah at the same time).

&amp;#x200B;

* What kind of (lightweight) solar panels (watt, volt) do I need for this? (I live in the Netherlands, not that sunny).
* Is it possible to charge 3 batteries at the same time in series (or parallel?). I'm only able to find information about 2 at the same time.
* What mppt/pwm would be sufficient?
* Any other (cheaper) options/ideas?
* Things I might overlook?

VanLife,"I've wanted to start living the van life for a few years now but to say the least I've just struggled to get my shit together and I haven't been able to get myself to buckle down and land a remote job that would allow me to do that. I'm 24 and literally have no other financial responsibilities other than my car as I am living with my parents. Scouting for possible freelance / remote work opportunities is not the main point of this post, but any input on that would also be welcome. Will probably even make a completely separate post about it...and now that I think about it I have no idea why I've never thought to pose that question on this sub.

Anyway back to my main question. Can anyone recommend some decent and affordable car insurance companies that have worked for them during their travels? My family and I have used Geico for a few years and of course they're great but I just tried to get a quote for a single person / vehicle and it was something like $200 per month. I believe this is largely in part because I've been in two minor accidents in the last five years and my driver's license has been suspended for over a year due to unpaid tickets. But I mean Geico is also one of the bigger and more established insurance companies, so similar to almost all other products and services that have big names and advertise on TV, I imagine there have to be some lesser known companies out there that offer as good or almost as good of coverage for less. 

In terms of what I would be looking for, roadside assistance really be the only thing I would want without question. Aside from that I'm not sure. Of course I also would like to not pay an arm and a leg if something were to happen to my vehicle while out on the road, but that's the case for everybody and why people get insurance in the first place.

Another relevant detail would be that I don't plan on constantly being out on the road month in and month out. My plan is to travel to different work-exchange programs / locations such as WWOOF, staying for 2-4 weeks at a time at each location.

VanLife,"Hey, my name is (forgot my redditname). Delete if not allowed but this has to be saod. Fair warning this is going to be a long post but I've been seeing a lot of miss information so I wanted to explain a normal life as a VanLifer. I no longer live in my Van because I never had Insulation so I saved to rent a place for the Winter then covid hit and I just kept to the house because I felt it was safer and I got a cat who helped me though loneness and depression. If you are a VanLifer Loneness and Depression are often part of the life, its sad but true. 

When I was living out my Van I didn't have all this fancy stuff. I keep seeing all these vans that been tricked out to have showers and toilets but if I'm being honest, if you can afford to spend 10k on a Van your better off getting a house or fixing your credit. Yes, the adventure part is fun but you know what else is fun? Not being in debt. All I had when I was in my Van was 8 pairs of cloths for the week that I put on more than once per week.  I smelled like shit sometimes but when that happened I just stayed in my Van away from people. When my clothes didnt read ""I'm Homeless!!!!"" I spent most of my time in coffee shops playing video games on my laptop and/or reading books while I charged my phone. I never had Internet in my van because the only way I got internet was using my phones hotspot and there's no way IN HELL I was going to waste that! Because if I got in a emergcy where I needed wifi on a weekend and the coffee shop is fully, or I couldnt afford a cup of coffee and would get kicked out I would feel stupid for wasting my hotspot on a game of Overwatch. Also I had to charge my phone in the coffee shop DURING THE DAY. My Van didnt charge when it was turned off so I would have to not use my phone during the day and use my laptop more so I would have charge for the next day so I can call work. I was thinking of buying a portable battery charger nut those cost MONEY. One of the most commonly asked question in the group is how we get money? I stayed in one city and had a full time job that paid shit! VanLife isnt for the rich people, this was made by the poor to get though life and somehow became a hashtag, idk. 

On my days off from work and I didnt feel like being around people I would adamantly drive over to the River and sit and read by the river all day. But I want to make this clear I stayed by the river for 2 reasons. Reason 1, It was beautiful and lovely to look at. Reason 2 GAS COST MONEY and money isnt something most VanLifers have. I cant afford to be driving around all the time and ever penny goes a long way. If you arent good with money your going to learn very quickly your going to need too be if you get into VanLifing. 100%, it 100% can save you a lot of money BUTTTTTTT your going to be living like a caveman for a year. A lot of people think they can be honest with themselves when asking how low teck they can live. Before you buy a van, go camping for a month NOT A WEEK and see how little you need and how much you can suffer. 

Also on my days off if it was raining and the river was flooding I would just sit in Walmart parking lots brain dead just listening to the rain. It was peaceful and beautiful and I found myself many days, but there were also days I was crying along with each raindrop as they died hitting my roof top. It's sad and its depressing living out a Van not matter how fancy it is! I would do this until 3pm because at 2pm a local coffee shop closes at that time, and me thinking about what would happen if cops coming up to my door as a black man (sad but true) , thought about how long it took for staff to clean up. So I would wait a hour until EVERYONE in the coffee shop was gone and the lights where off that I drove up to the parking lot closet to the coffee shop just to use the wifi and watch Netflix in peace. At the same time I would set a reminder on my phone to wake myself up at 4AM in the morning because they opened at 6am so I had to get out a hour early so they didnt see me. And if they did see me they would think ""oh its that homeless guy who lives out his Van he's normally gone before we open so he wont bug us"" I never got the cops called on me by them thankfully but it very well can happen no matter what color you are. 

So now its 4Am and you got nothing to do and no where to go, so you do the only thing you can do, Go to a 24hour fitness with your 10$ a month member ship and use the showers but not until you work out for 30mins so they dont catch on that your homeless.  If you think your that guy who will be like ""I don't care if people know im living out of my Van"" trust me you will, at least I hope you will because I found people who do are far better off. People don't want to help people who are homeless, and you might have some negative feelings about calling yourself homeless but if your a VanLifer even part time thats how the world is going to see you,, if not thats how they saw me. 

Now after you take your shower and workout you still have 1 or 2 hours  before anything is open, that time is easy to kill reading or playing games on your phone (the 24hour fitness has plug ins so you can charge your phone more) then from there it starts all over again. This isnt to mention dating. But since that different from person to person I wont talk about that. 

 This is not meant to be a ""your so naive"" post because I really REALLY loved living out my Van full time and I miss it and I would do it again is I didnt have my Cat. But she got me thought Covid and depression so I wont go back and force her into a small space. 
This post was created because I feel like way to many people are falling into the hashtag VanLife that they have 0 idea of what they really are getting into. All those fancy high dollar vans are shit and I cant think they even work all that well. I mean if you think of how well houses are made what makes you think they are going to put more effort into your van? If you can afford that type of van and want to get into VanLife, sure its your life do it but its far better to get a cheaper van and put that money aside and pay off debts. I hope this helped at least one person. I love you all, lets stay grounded to reality and hopefully bring a end to all this high dollar VanLife bs

While on this trip I was the happiest and most free I‚Äôve felt in my entire life. Now that I‚Äôve been back for 5 months I‚Äôm not sure which path to take. Should I save up some more money for a couple months again and travel but be unsure about my future. I want to travel full time and have the thrill and adventure I had on that trip that I once took, but unfortunately this isn‚Äôt sustainable I want to be able to connect with people through social media and help them.

What sort of things should I look for when buying a van? Any common issues that I should be aware of, and be looking out for? Any particular makes/ models you think work well?

Conversion van: 

Easy to get on the road quickly. Known to go for miles. Hoping for a high top but if not I feel like bending over all of the time could be annoying. Can tow a lot, so I could buy a travel trailer or a pop up camper to tow if I need more space. I think they‚Äôre bad on gas mileage because they‚Äôre big mama V8‚Äôs. I have never towed anything so that would be a learning curve for me as well. 

Toyota dolphin: 

It‚Äôs a freaking Toyota dolphin. I‚Äôm obsessed with them and they will only be useable for so long!!! Right now they‚Äôre all about 20-30 years old, but have the 22 RE which makes up for it. Vans don‚Äôt seem to be much newer anyways. Might run into issues with rust, leaks or water damage. Will have to learn all of the ropes on how to operate an RV. They‚Äôre small and compact so I bet they‚Äôre easier than a van towing a trailer to maneuver and I‚Äôd be more comfortable. Obviously it‚Äôs a full motor home so more space to renovate, fix or watch out for but also way more living space and I‚Äôll never have to crouch down. I‚Äôm not sure how much better gas mileage would be in a dolphin either, so that could be a downside. Also, finding a decent dolphin that I can get on the road right away is gonna cost me. Good because I can restore and probably sell it for the same amount I bought it or close to it... bad because I will probably pay double what I‚Äôd pay for a good to go conversion van.

I worked 60 hours, saved up that extra money, and put it starting up side businesses for 10k. Then I invested that little side business revenue along with my job income into certain investments and ended up with 40k. With that money I could have easily started up a van life, but instead I decided to purchase a business space to start up my own coffee shop. This will prevent me from buying a van for at least 3 years, because I need to work at least 80hr/wk to manage this shop to grow it into a sustainable business, with the potential of opening up more coffee shops. So what I'm doing is setting up a foundation that is going to allow me to have income coming in.

My case is more extreme than most, but the point being is that **if you're thinking about van life, it's okay to not jump the gun and instead start building up the foundation.**

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Community** \- Especially with the pandemic the van life has really skyrocketed, and there are so many apps/ websites/ youtube channels dedicated to all of this since a good foundation has been laid for van dwellers. Youtube just has so much content about anything you need to look for, and most people are pretty good about responding.

For example, I have watched hundreds of videos on how solar powered energy works, what components are required, and now I can build a solid system at a fraction of the cost.

Same with heating/ air conditioning: I plan on making a video on how to build an air conditioning system using the method of thermal transfer that doubles as a cooler/fridge so you that you don't need to spend $1k on those overly expensive Dometic fridges (it draws about the same power as a compact/dorm fridge I don't know why people think those are better when it's smaller room and you now have to adjust to opening the door up instead of sideways). I learned through Youtube just how much more efficient it is to understand how those fridges work and how much insulation makes a bigger difference.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Technology/Build** \- I remember even five years back there weren't as many conversions on high top vans (transit/promaster/sprinter) decked with high powered solar systems. It was mostly cargo vans and the occasional vintage vans with roof extensions. So I thought I'd be fine with a Ford Econoline/ Chevy Astro if I could fit a bed in, a minimal kitchen space. But after the years have passed, I realized that I need a certain level of comfort in order for me to enjoy van life for **AT LEAST TWO YEARS**. If it's less than that I need to consider what I'm investing in and how that is going to be worth it, aside from the experience of being able to travel around. 

In the past 6 years I:

* worked in construction for year
* used those building skills to help build up a restaurant
* used the restaurant skills to start up a food truck 
* used all those things to start up my own cafe

With everything I've done up to this point, I now have the understanding of how to build the van from scratch, and be able to hook up plumbing/ electrical/ propane/ solar. With all this information, I have decided that I can build an affordable van for under 20k that can do more than what most of the youtube van lifers can do. My build is finding the most efficient/ affordable DIY builds for almost everything. This involves wanting the following:

* **12-16ft Box Truck**. Everyone seems to have the high top cargo vans, and while I see that as being more than sufficient, I personally don't think it's worth spending that much on a vehicle you could give up in less than a few years. I see so many van builds being sold on ebay/craigslist for 40k-80k and the problem is that because of all the work done in it (gutting out insides/ foam spray insulation) that the resell value of these vans don't go for that much. And people charge an astronomical amount for the items they bought and especially the work they put into it, but the issue with that is most people want to build it themselves to fit their needs, and do not have the money to invest all at once.
* **24V or 48V Solar Power system with DIY LiFePo4 battery cell system**. If all you need is power to run vent fans/ lights/ usb chargers, a 12V solar power system can be built for under $300.  A proper 24V/48V system could run as much as $5k-8k, but if you learn how to properly/safely create your own system you can have enough power to run a fridge/laptop/television for 1/3 of the cost. For now I plan on buying a small 12v system just to test out at home, learning how to wire/connect all the parts correctly and learning what mistakes I could possibly make.
* **100lb propane system for water tank/ heater/ stove with an oven**. Propane is cheapest for all these applications and is so efficient I don't know why anyone bothers getting an electric induction stove or heater. I also opt for 100lbs because I've owned a food truck with a 30lb propane tank and it was such a hassle to find places to fill up frequently. If you're also using one of those 5lb tanks that you can swap out at a big box store, the cost to maintain that will far outweigh initially setting up a proper system, even within half a year. This is one of the reasons a box truck comes in handy, so you can make a separate compartment to install this.
* **Proper plumbing system for kitchen and bathroom/shower**. Up until a few months back I have never thought I would want/ need a shower or toilet for the van and all I would need is a Planet Fitness membership. The thought of setting it up/ the space it takes/ how to even clean a toilet and the smell/ possible mold from the humidity, all made me not even consider it. However, after seeing many builds, a lot have opted for a shower with a compostable toilet (with vent) inside, and I now want to build a closed door bathroom, but with shower/ toilet separated. If I already have a 12V pump/ propane heater for the sink, it doesn't cost extra to run it, just extra building materials. I also plan to host friends, and it would make everyone feel less weird to have them find a pee jar or look for a bathroom all the time. 
* There is a lot more that I want to add, but honestly I also am usually one to learn as I go, and also be able to add as I go, so I plan on building the van out where I can make modifications much easier down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say that people will start figuring out more efficient/ convenient ways of navigating around van life, and this is all totally doable if you're willing to commit the time to it. While people say ""if this is what you want to do, just go out there and do it"", I say just take it with a grain of salt and keep the dream in mind but always be working towards the goal. Hope that helped give some people a different take on starting van life!","I wanted to convert a van since I was 23. I am 30 now and I still haven't done it, and I'm glad I'm waiting.

I've been think and planning on starting van life for the past year, just waiting for covid and life to straighten out a bit, then i'm off on the adventure. I've never owned / bought a car before, and of the whole project the parts that worries me the most is the buying of the van. I dont know what makes one van good/bad, what a good asking price, where i could buy one (currently in NYC). How to check that its good and won't break down, or where i can learn to fix up smaller problems. 

Ideally i'd love to buy a used electric Camper on the smaller side, and tall enough for me to stand in (i'm 5""10,) but those usall tend to be sooo expensive, I'm open to any van, I'd also rather get a van that costs more upfront but wont require as much cost and upkeep down the road.  and have a general budget of 6,500 for the van. 

And help, recomendation, evaluation, tips would be greatly appreciated.

VanLife,"Just wanted to share with the vanlife community.  On our Sprinter van, we don't have solar.  We do have the Goal Zero Yeti 1000 battery pack.  Goal Zero manufactures a device called the Yeti Link Expansion Car Link Module which will let you charge the Yeti using your alternator.  But - you most likely need to update your firmware, it is a proprietary device that will only work with the Goal Zero line of products, it uses up the space for the MPPT controller (so you can't run the Car Link module and the MPPT module at the same time) and if you wanted it today - they are out of stock until the Spring of 2021 for technical enhancements.  

I put together a video showing you how I charge the Yeti 1000 using a Victron Orion DC-DC charger.  Connections are super simple.  Connect positive and negative from your starter battery to the Victron Orion.  Connect positive and negative from the Orion to a vertically stacked Anderson Power Pole plug.  Then connect it to the Input side of the Goal Zero.

The Goal Zero battery pack works very well - we love it!  Charging it while we drive (without solar!) is a huge plus - it charges at just under 360W.  So in less than 3 hours I can go from a near empty battery to full.  

I will never drain my starter battery with this setup - in the Victron Connect app I set the ON/OFF parameters when the Victron Orion will charge.  It is also isolated from the vehicle electrical system, and the Orion also has it's own built in fuse.  Some neat features!  

In my Sprinter van, I leave it connected all the time.  If I run errands, I'm always charging the battery.  Super important to have something like this when you live in the northern hemisphere where the days are short, and there is no sunshine due to rain (Vancouver Canada!) and snow (Toronto!)

Hope this helps you.  Here's a link to the video I put together:

VanLife,"TL;DR: Van life throws curve balls; Do bring pup for emotional well-being.

Hi there, long time reader here, first time posting.

I‚Äôm writing from a Motel 6, unable to sleep, and just a bit overwhelmed by it all. Not quite what I had pictured for my first extended stay in my van.

I‚Äôm a week into travelling in my self-converted 2016 RAM Promaster 1500, ~63K miles. It had been looked over by two separate mechanics around last August, and after a few minor repairs, I was told it has a clean Bill of health.  But this week, the Check Engine Light came on twice. 

The first mechanic I took it to in North Carolina cleared the error codes and explained to me that Promasters are prone to false alarms for oil pressure. He seemed honest and even refused my money when I tried to pay him. 

But then, the dreaded light came on again yesterday, en route to South Carolina. This time, I took it to a Pep Boys and after a $100 diagnostic test, I got news that there‚Äôs issues with my transmission. Since this branch of Pep Boys does not do transmission repairs, they sent me to a mechanic they recommended. 

There, I was told my transmission‚Äôs torque converter and clutch solenoid both had to be replaced, and that luckily, they had the parts on hand and could make it an overnight job. The total quote was $1900 plus tax. 

This is a pretty big sum to me, but I just bit the bullet and agreed to it. I asked if I could stay in my van overnight when they weren‚Äôt working on it, but it was a no-go, so I found a Motel 6 which was a 40min walk away. 

I‚Äôm trying to stay positive, and think of this expensive repair as something preemptive of even more costly consequences farther down the line. But it‚Äôs certainly hard not to second guess if I had made the right decisions under pressure... Or if there might be something more to learn from this experience? I‚Äôm certainly freaking out a bit at the financial repercussions of today.

Van lifers, do you have tips for dealing with days like these? Or on how to get more educated on van maintenance?

All I can say is I am sure glad I have my pup with me right now. He is my little anchor! I can‚Äôt wait to be back in my van, and to put this all behind me.

VanLife," The Public House Project is a re-imagining of modern American life. It combines the growing movements of van life with the idea of a co-housing community.¬† At the heart of the community is the shared house.¬† No one lives long term in the house.¬† It is decorated and stocked with¬† every thing you need to cook, including basic grocery items, locally sourced as much as possible. Homes are stylish, modern, comfortable homes to share.¬†  


Guests rent private, small parking areas, or rent a small tent in a private area.¬† All vehicles and tents include, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.¬† Costs of renting a place is still being worked out, but we aim to be very reasonable for everything you get, and totally flexible, come and go as you please.   


On the grounds of the property it is up to the community to decide what they'd like. Some ideas include growing gardens, building ninja obstacles for fun workouts, and/or install solar and make the house as green as possible.  Down the road we aim to make homes co-owned by those who live at them.  


The Public House Project is a better, more social, less expensive, more energy efficient way to live.¬† Imagine a network of Public Homes across of these United States. Move for fun, move for work, move for a relationship, you'll still have your home and your community there when you want it, when you need it.

Submissions should be one page (multiple pages will be considered individually): campsite/hike map, writing, or combo. Everything should be handwritten/drawn (nothing typed). 

Campsites should be free, public, specifically designated as a campsite (no stealth required), and be a lesser-known site (we want to lessen our impact by using less trafficked areas, instead of overusing the most popular spots). All campsites should have 2WD road access (no 4x4 or backpacking/walk-in sites). Finally, you should have hiked the hike or spent the night at the site in either January or February 2021 (we want to know how the campsite is in WINTER -- snowy is fine).

Writing should focus on one of the following themes: low impact camping/travel, leave no trace, wilderness ethics, perseverance, resilience, grit, outdoor living, van life, hope, counter-culture, resistance, etc. 

You can submit as many pages as you'd like. It's important to me to pay people for their art -- if accepted, contributors will be paid $10/page, payment upon publication (late March or early April).

We have the smallest sprinter so there will be no need for power for any kitchen appliances as we will be doing all our cooking outside. So with the power we need i ask you-

* Do you prefer solar panels that are permanent or would you recommend portable solar? pros/cons?
* how much power would we need?

Generally speaking, Renters Insurance covers your ""stuff"" anywhere in the world. There are exclusions -- things like high value electronics, jewelry, artwork and instruments often require separate riders.

But if you have your bag in the trunk of your car stolen, your renters insurance policy will generally cover that loss (after the deductible). 

But what about the contents of a van? **And what about the _retrofit itself_?** Can the cost of the materials be claimed in case of loss, like a fire, _against a renter's insurance policy_?

If it was an apartment fire, yes, you could claim the cost of your bed and furniture. But what if it is in a van?

You couldn't claim the sweat equity, obviously. But what about the cost of materials if you have the receipts.

my question is- between a 120V and 12V fridge- is the actual AH consumed that much different? i know part of the issue is in the inverter being on 24/7, which I figured I could fix by attaching a small 300W inverter to the back of the fridge, which should be an almost negligible daily power draw, maybe 4 amps a day (am i wrong?).

if I were to do that, will the 120V fridge still end up drawing more power? i‚Äôve read the size i‚Äôm looking at (3.2 cu ft) draws about 50-100W, whereas the same size 12V draws 180W.

VanLife,"It's my first post in this sub so nice to meet everything and wish you all a happy new year! 

I appreciate some advice to kick off my very first and probably the most important step - which is getting the van. 

I tried with SUV camping before jumping in with more investment into this lifestyle and I know I absolutely love it. So now comes down to a few choices: 

* I can buy a cargo van and do the conversion myself
* Buy an RV Van that has already been converted
* Or find someone to do it for me 

Budget wise I have enough to put down on a house, and I think I'll just spend a portion of that on a van, but being more money conscious I'd prefer to spend less if possible. 

Prebuilt RV van is an easy option and a peace of mind too but comes with its price tag (100k+ I believe), and also not that stealth in street parking given they all comes with that RV paint style which I also dislike. 

But I'm also not that handy, so building my own van would be a daunting task to say the least, unless there's resource online that can hand-hold me throughout this process. 

If not, then it comes down to the third option (to commision someone to do it for me). I have absolutely no idea how costly it is (my expectation on the outcome is one of those nice-looking vans you will see on social media), and if that will bring it still cheaper than a prebuilt RV van then it may be a no-brainer to go with this option. That said, I also struggle to find a van conversion company (and I live in bay area which is probably not the easiest place to find that I guess).

Keep in mind: I‚Äôm female but I‚Äôm not a sissy :-P. I‚Äôve used nature and outhouses, and I‚Äôve gone probably 2 weeks without a shower before. I just don‚Äôt want the smell and I want life to be comfortable if it‚Äôs long-term. Did you set up a toilet/shower space in your van? Does anyone use a composting toilet? What is clean up of your toilet setup like? Did you hook up plumbing? Do you use a solar shower, inside van, or find other places to shower? There‚Äôs a lot to choose from so I‚Äôm curious about your experiences. I‚Äôd also love pics if you‚Äôre willing to share.

This video was recorded at Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve on Vancouver Island, Canada. 

The video is primarily a review of the 29 litre Mobicool V30, 12 volt DC Cooler/Warmer. It also serves as a tutorial on how I compartmentalize to maximize the limited storage capacity of this small cooler. Using a small shelf and a number of small storage containers, I am able to pack away a considerable amount of perishable food. 

The video ends with a short walk from the parking area to Long Beach, followed by a walk along the beach. The scenery is breathtaking!

VanLife,"Hello, friends! Wishing you a safe and warm winter season.

TL;DR: Getting a bigger vehicle for urban car living. passenger van (eg, Ford Escape) vs. mini cargo van (Ford Transit Connect). Similar prices.

I'm about to have to leave my apartment, so will be moving into a car full time in the next couple weeks. I currently have a 2008 Ford Focus which I have lived out of for about a week in the past; however, that is too small to be sustainable.

I'm weighing pros and cons of each van type. Gas mileage, style/shape, price, and most other factors are roughly equal. The one difference is that I like the greater storage capacity of the cargo van, but have worries about stealth and security. It will stand out wherever I park it and I am nervous about becoming a target for damage or theft. I don't plan to do a fancy build or anything, but don't want to throw out all of my clothes and crafting supplies. I'm downsizing for sure, but the passenger van will have *very* little storage space. I also like the idea of the cargo van since it seems more bearable for longer term car living and intermittent travel/car camping. I have places to be during the day (with water, showers, heat, electricity, etc.), so will mostly only be sleeping in the van. I want to plan for a bearable place to be for a couple days at a time as needed though.

I'm curious to know your advice on ways to keep some consistent routines and habits while living on the road.

I have the privilege of working from home and not because of covid, I earn location independent income and work for myself. I love the opportunities van life presents itself and it's a lifestyle I feel I would enjoy.

I do have some concerns however, I have some routines and habits I would like to be able to keep. I'm a gym regular and I like to wake up early each day. Getting proper sleep and a good workout in each day are big for me. I'd imagine having to find a place to sleep each night could become a huge hassle. On top of that, I sometimes have to take important phone calls with clients and be able to actually get work done and remain productive and in fact, I enjoy working and having to utilize my skillset as opposed to sleeping around all day. Is there any recommended places to park during the day to get work done in a somewhat quiet environment?

I know van life won't be a smooth transition as this is an alternative lifestyle but I have seen a few business owners giving it a shot. So I feel I could also adopt the lifestyle if I'm willing to get rid of some simple comforts and make some sacrifices. I feel that the payoff is way better in comparison to owning fancy material things and a big house I would never actually utilize.

sorry to ask like this - I know some of this is explained in FAQs but I would really like to talk with someone / a few people about this. Apologies if these are dumb questions to ask here, I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction!  


recently bought a ford transit, I guess it's a mk6 but actually will have to wait for the log book to be sent back to my postal address to find out.

Questions:

to fit insulation - can i just tape it? bought a roll of aluminium foil tape earlier.

moisture resistance - can I just fit a polythene sheet on the near side of the insulation? how do I actually 'secure' it? I am guessing it shouldn't be too tight to the insulation as well, is that true or does it not matter?

in the ribs of the body - have I done a stupid thing by buying a litres' worth of soudal expanding foam? where can I look for a good guide to instal it without popping the ribs or whatever?

I will probably ask a few follow questions if anyone is able to help me out, apologies for this!  
best wishes all

previous owner kitted it out for summer, but from what I've read/heard it sounds like their sticking of a reflective layer to the body would only have aided heat conduction anyway, now it is bloody freezing in there, I've taken out one side's worth of reflective material, going to clean off what remains of the glue/adhesive tonight on that side at least, might take the other panels off too.

VanLife,"Hi all - I‚Äôm looking to get some information and recommendations about the equipment Id like to install in my tiny camper for next spring-fall camping season.

I converted a 5x8 6‚Äô tall cargo trailer into a camper for my 4 person family. Bunk beds go sideways in the back for my 6 and 2 year old, there‚Äôs a cabinet, fold up  wall mounted table, and my wife and I have a mattress pad that doubles as a couch and bed on the floor.

Normally when we sleep my feet are under the bottom bunk because it‚Äôs raised and I‚Äôm over 6‚Äô tall, but my wife is just over 5‚Äô and she doesn‚Äôt need the foot space on her side. So under that side of the bunk I plan to install a 32 L fridge. It‚Äôll fit perfectly almost like the bunk was made for the fridge. Lucked out with how perfect the fit is.

It‚Äôs a 45W fridge. So I‚Äôm not sure how much I need for a battery and what kind of solar panel will keep that battery charged appropriately. The fridge is roughly 3.75 Ah when the compressor is running, and if I overestimate that 40% of the time the compressor will be running I figure it‚Äôll probably work out to maybe 1.5 Ah. So I‚Äôd need approximately 36-40 amp hours per day for the fridge.

I don‚Äôt plan running anything else off the battery. I also have a 50,000mAh battery pack for phones, and our lights and fans are rechargeable and last the whole weekend when we camp.

Would a single 100 Ah deep cycle battery be fine for that fridge? Would a 60-100W panel be enough to keep the battery mostly full if only the fridge was drawing from it?","12v fridge, battery, and solar.",1,False,Futuregymowner

* Smaller pieces so might be easier to cut around structurals bits of van and contour to the shape
* Easier to remove a single piece or two if needed in the future

Pros for plywood:

* Structurally stronger and I could attach things directly into this (shelving etc)

VanLife,"Hi friends! Today, I was staying inside my vehicle outside the back of a Sear's parking lot, and while I was working on some business, I have my solar panels and solar generator hooked up in order to use my laptop during the day. Anyways, this police officer came up next to me. Then he lit up his sirens for a second to grab my attention, and I thought I was in trouble. Great, my second interaction with the police because I'm ""homeless living in a vehicle"" and somebody decided to be all judgmental and call the police. This dude was a supervisor, too!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, he noticed my solar set up, and asked me questions about it. He wanted to know what my generator was, how much power I was pulling in, how long I can stay without solar, etc. So many questions, and luckily I had a lot of answers for him from my research into solar for the last half a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

This police officer supervisor, who looked like he was in his 50's or 60's, was completely jealous of my set up. He was baffled by the fact that I could work behind a Sear's parking lot, but I explained to him I have unlimited cellular in order to connect to WiFi essentially anywhere. And that made him even more intrigued, and jealous of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

He asked about my expenses, and then his jaw dropped. Living rent-free means lowered expenses means incredible money making opportunities. And with solar, I personally don't see why anybody would want to buy a house. Sure, we're not making the 3% passive income every year from owning a house, but we have so little expenses it doesn't really matter, and can focus our money on other things, like bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just felt the need to share. Because knowing that a 50's or 60's year old is jealous of me, a person younger than 30, is something that is an absolutely incredible feeling, personally. This dude has worked his entire life, day in, day out, as a police officer, serving the betterment of society, all for society to hate on him, and he's financially struggling so much he's leaving the state and building an off-grid house to decrease his expenses. That's just sad... Dude worked his entire life serving the community, and he can't even retire. But that's  life now, and we must adapt. Living paycheck to paycheck, paying 1/3 of your income to rent, 5 out of 7 days of your entire life, only to retire at 65 to have.. maybe 10 okay ish years of retirement? That's ridiculous!

My partner and I are residents of Florida. We moved in 4ish years ago, rented apartments and did everything by the book when it comes to drivers licenses, insurance, etc etc.

We decided that we can work from the road and bought a towing vehicle planning to build up a travel trailer to work from anywhere we can get cell phone reception. We just cancelled our lease, got rid of everything that did not fit in our cars, and came up to New England to spend the holidays and start getting our towing vehicle ready for our future adventures.

For address, we decided to remain as residents of Florida, and we are paying a mail forwarding service that explicitly allows to use their address as ""permanent address"", and we are planning on switching our drivers licenses and auto insurance to that location.

Now, here's my problem: auto insurance requires a garage address. We do not live, nor park our vehicle in the address we will be using for residence. So legally, this may be seen as a misrepresentation. I would not like to get in a situation in which my insurance denies a claim and I have to cover liability.

However, World Nomads is considered a ""secondary"" health insurance, which (I think) would cover things that a primary insurance doesn't cover. BUT what if I didn't have a primary insurance? Would WN cover me? 

Are there van lifers out there or nomads in the US that use World Nomads as their ONLY health insurance? 

And in general, what do van lifers do for insurance without paying absurd costs? My budget is $300-400 per month",Health Insurance for van lifers within the US,1,False,TheOriginalSando

I‚Äôm converting to vanlife to travel and work myself out of my crippling debt, so I was so happy that I traded in for free, and the dealership did work for free, and now they will have to do more work for free because I just discovered that the drivers side door isn‚Äôt locking from the inside, outside, or with the faab. Also the abs light turned on. I am now realizing how much rust the van has.. I mean theres rusted holes in the floor, there‚Äôs gaps around the doors.. I‚Äôm going to be insulting and putting up walls, but now I‚Äôm so worried that it won‚Äôt all be enough with all that rust.
I typically remain positive about these things, after all, things can be fixed. I‚Äôm in the worst financial situation of my life right now. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt have any money saved, and over 10k in cc debt. I haven‚Äôt been working due to being sick... I‚Äôm so worried all the sudden that this won‚Äôt work out.. that this van is going to keel over the moment I try and drive out of state.

VanLife,"So, now that it's my first winter in my van... my panels are not cutting it.  I have 300w of panels and 200ah of Li batteries, and a couple days of overcast weather and I'm a sitting duck.  I'm going to install a DC-DC charger to connect my AGM car battery with my Li house batteries and tap into the power being produced by my 135a alternator.

I'm going with a DC-DC charger instead of an isolator because I've read they are safer for the alternator, and give you more control (can manually turn on/off instead of being forced to run on a timer or all the time).

Some questions though:  I have seen that alternators can burn out if you are running a DC-DC charger while idling.  How can I mitigate that risk?  I'd like to be able to idle my engine for 30 minutes here and there while camp is set up, to top up my Li batteries, but not if I'm going to be running the risk of damaging my alternator or starting a fire.

Also, how hard is it to set up so that I can turn it on/off manually instead of it just starting with the ignition switch?  My primary means of charging will still be my panels.  Do most chargers have a switch on the unit where I can just set to on/off as I please?

Finally- how do I monitor how much charge I'm taking in? Do I just assume it will always be running at capacity, so if I have a 40a DC-DC and I run the engine for an hour, I just gained 40ah?  Is there any way to be more precise and maybe monitor the exact current like I can with my panels via Charge Controller and Bluetooth module?

I have some ideas on attaching it diagonally across the van using either the support struts or the seemingly endless amounts of little holes in the frame.   
this article seems to have the best set up ive seen so far: [Here](https://www.cheaprvliving.com/conversion-details/4x4-van-conversion-sleeping-in-a-hammock-in-a-van/). Another article reccomended bolting eye bolts near a hole so I can reach in and manangle it tightened on the inner metal bits. 

I cant find many builds where yall use a hammock so I wanted to make a post and ask for thoughts and suggestions before I go all the way and make holes or do something I didnt think all the way through.   
pros for hammocking full time: space saver: easy to put up, quick to take down, underquilt for heat is cheap, no breeze inside van to make you cold so bundle up as much as you want in the winter or as little as you need in the summer, park at angle and sleep just fine.   
cons: one person at most (for safety reasons sadly), uncomfy for some, takes getting used to, might not be warm enough all winter (alone), could possibly hang wrong.

Fiberine is the only option I‚Äôve found and it would be 6-7k depending if I want them to add windows and do a ceiling fan. We live in NorCal but my brother lives down south so we could drive down, drop the van off at Fiberine and stay with him while they do the upgrade. 

My fianc√© and I play music and have a band together. We bought the van about 6 years ago for that reason, and we‚Äôve already circled the country quite a few times and driven through Canada in jt.

It would be awesome to not have to spend that much on a raised roof so we can continue saving and doing the other upgrades, but being able to stand up in the van is pretty close to a necessity if we‚Äôre both gonna be in there full time.

Not sure who I should come to with this idea but I wanted to get some feedback on the best way to do this.  Im going to be doing some camping in my trailer in some cold alpine environments (in the teens and below at night) and am looking for an alternative to propane for heating.  I could camp pretty close to some hot springs and I had this idea to use them as a potential heat source. (dont worry about fumes, camped here many times without the camper).  I want to run a hose from the springs, through a radiator + fan combi or something like that inside the trailer then hose back to the stream.  Itll depend on a few variables but I think that I can park the trailer in a way that the inlet is a bit higher elevation than the outlet hose which means that I could run it continuously as a siphon instead of running a pump.

Has anyone had any experience with something like this?  If im using a 3/4"" hose and need to pump the water about 30' and up maybe 5', what size pump would you use? Any other thoughts on the best heat exchanger?

Anyways, I've got a 1977 VW Camper with a stock 30 amp/12 volt alternator which is connected to a standard Optima starting battery. The starting battery is connected to a Renogy DCC50S DC-DC MPPT solar charge charger which is connected to two roof-mounted 160 Watt Renogy solar panels and two Renogy 200 ah Gel Hybrid aux batteries. I'd like to add the ‚ÄúRenogy 2000 Watt 12V DC to 120V AC Pure Sine Wave Inverter Charger‚Äù ( PCL1-20111S ) to the mix, however, I'm concerned about how the two Renogy chargers will behave.

\-Should I connect the PCL1-20111S directly to the aux batteries along with the DCC50S or should I connect the PCL1-20111S to the starting battery and let the DCC50S send the charge from the starting battery to the aux batteries?

\-If I have both the solar (via the DCC50S) and shore power (via the  PCL1-20111S) directly connected to the aux batteries, which will do the charging? Will one take precedence? Will they both switch on and off rapidly as the voltage rises and falls due to the chargers detecting the incoming voltage as the battery voltage? Or will they both just work together to charge the batteries?

I'm looking for a very specific electrical product and striking out online, figured I'd ask around here. A while ago I installed a USB charging panel in my trailer a while ago that wires directly into my 12v system. It works great, but the max output for each port is just 2A (= \~10W total). This is okay for small electronics (phone etc) but I'm looking at getting a new laptop that charges with USB-C, and am worried it would take forever to charge.  
I know some of the newer USB flavors support much higher charging rates (up to 100W according to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB\_hardware#Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#Power)) but all the 12VDC wall mounts I can find online seem to have the same 2A restriction. I've found some USB ports up to 4A, but they all seem to require 120VAC input, and I'd like to avoid an inverter and stay with 12VDC input if possible.

i'm planning on having 760 watts of solar panels, and also hooking up my system to my alternator. 

i've (guess)timated that my daily consumption would be around 220AH.  first question- would \~400AH stored be a go? the recommendation i've gotten from the calculators online is 700-800 AH stored, but i can't ever see myself not getting ANY charge from the solar or alternator for two days. or am i crazy.

second question- which would be better, 4 100AH lithium ion batteries + inverter + isolators + all the bits and pieces (and lots of time) needed to assemble (aka \~$4k) OR 2 bluetti solar power stations (400AH total) ($3.4k).  using the 2 bluettis seems like a slightly cheaper, easier way to get this done, but am i missing something? am i entertaining an impossible reality? lol

1. Get a fan and suck it up 
2. Buy household plug in air con unit, and a petrol or diesel generator which I will put underneath the van outside and run the lead through the door seal and power the air con, refilling the generator each day when stopping for fuel

I share some photos of my van.

I moved out of my apartment in the summer, and into this sprinter van in the spring. I'm in my 30s now, and ever since I was in high school, I always wanted to big 'ole van. I had hitch hiked and stealth camped in my early 20s. 

I had been looking at sprinters since 2017. I went to the dealership. They said with covid, next year's production is uncertain, and they are clearing out their older inventory. 

When I bought it, it was crammed with seats. I took those out, but kept a row so I could make a 5 seater if needed. But as you might have seen, it's just a metal room on wheels with windows.

I've been living out of it for several months, and have driven across country a couple times. Now there are lockdowns, and it is much safer that I have a semi-permanent stay. 

As is, the vehicle is not temperature controlled, so it isn't very livable during the winter. There is no insulation, and the floor, walls, and ceiling are bare. There are many good modifications to do with this van, but I'm not committed to spending time on the van.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I wanted to get this out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently own a 2016 Dodge Promaster 3500, high roof, extended, that I've been working on transforming into a van for full time vanlife. Things I've got done in the van so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Insulation

Roof Vent Fan

Sub floor

Flooring

Bed frame

Shower

Electrical

Solar Panels

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working on installing the walls, and doing a couple of other things. My initial plan was to have this project finished in August, however, between Covid Shutdowns and Social distancing, the project keeps getting stalled. I am not proficient with tools, and have almost no construction skills or knowledge. Everything I've done so far has been with help, trial-and-error, advice, and Youtube.   


I have most of the supplies for the build already purchased. I don't have a lot of the tools, and have been using the help of parents, and a couple of friends to get the job done. However, their time is only available during weekends, and those weekends that are available for them is few and far between. Not a fault of their own, just a conflict of schedule.   


The problem I'm facing right now: I SUCK at construction, and I could really use some guidance, teaching, and help, finishing the project. I have funds built up, materials purchased, and an open schedule. I'm looking to find anyone in the lower 48 that would be willing for me to drive out to where you are. I'm willing to pay for the help! I want the finishing steps (mainly cabinets) to look decent, and if I had a crack at it, it will probably come out pretty rough.   


Not sure if this is the best place to post this. If you would be able to help work things out, please be sure to reach out to me. Willing to drive anywhere in the lower 48 and work around a schedule that best suits you.

The Espar is using its built-in temperature sensor to figure out when to turn off / on the unit.  Since it's located in a contained space, it's probably much warmer in there, and therefore the rest of the van isn't staying warm because it's adjusting for its little space, not the actual van.

So I'm considering buying an add-on, which is an external temperature sensor. They seem to run $65.

VanLife,"In a flat im not even living from month to month and feel i'll endessly be stuck in this cycle of debt. So i want to save money for a year to try to get myself out of the cycle. So I want to know some tips to spend as little as possible living in a van. I have very basic needs and I cant afford to do an amazing van conversion. Im hoping some people have tried just basic matress in a van and thats it. Or if not, whats the absolute basics?

As an overview, im happy to spend my days working where I can, on hikes, in libraries, malls, even vounlenteering, etc. The van is mostly for just sleeping.   
Here are the elements i've considered:

**Toilet:** During the day ill probably by covered by public services or places im wokring/voulenteering, but at night, im less sure. I've looked a bit into ""wag"" bags and chemical toilets. What's the cheapest solution? I'm ok to empty the toilet daily if i need to.   
**Water:**  I assume I can utliize public water supplies for my basic drinking water needs. But what about for things like general washing, etc, what are some good suggestions?  
   
**Power:** All I need is my phone occasionally to stay in touch (daily check in really is it). Maybe listen to some music or playing a game from time to time...let's say a full charge would last me 2 days. and basic lighting when I need it at night. So would a small solar power panel do the trick? Also, can you use public libraries, etc to charge during the day? 

**Food:** im very unfussy for food. Eg, I can easily eat chikpeas and lentils every day and not mind. I'm more concerned for health reasons to get all my vitamins. Suggestions on cheap eating that wont give me scurvvy? Honestly, ill eat the same meal every day i dont mind.  I'd buy a little camping stove too

**Accomidation / Parking:** I'm not doing this to travel, im doing this to live/survive. Are there any places that are cheaper / better for long term stays? For example, I even know that people rent out their car spaces, id be fine with this. my van would just be for sleeping and relaxing. To get the most opportunities for casual work, I need to be closer to a city so camping grounds miles away probably are only suitable for weekends. any ideas?

**Showering:**I'm happy to shower less than daily, but probably no more than 3 days. If you live near a beach, does a dip in the beach stop you from smelling too badly? Also, beaches often have free showers to rinse, do these do the trick? 

**Mail:** I suspect that this kind of lifestyle doesnt generate too much mail, but for basic things, do you use friends or families addresses, PO boxes?

**Freshening up:** I don't want to hide away from the world completely so, from time to time ill need to use a proper bathroom, iron up some clothes, etc. to make myself presentable. I don't have that many friends. I'm thinking casual pass at a gym is the only real solution? Any others?

VanLife,"Hi, I'm a software engineer and recently CS teacher. For many years now I have been looking at the pros and cons of living in a van. I'm as close as I ever got to make the move but my reflexion is halted at the moment by a very specific bump in the road ; long-term financial investment.

I wouldn't want to compare the choice of going vanlife with buying and living in a house or a condo, but I want to make sense of the financial aspect that is often brought as an argument in favor of doing the former. Financial freedom is a great goal that living in a van will help you achieve. I'm all for that, but what I'm concerned about is the financial aftermath.

When you buy a house for exemple, apart from coming with all it's related pros and cons, the deal is that you buy something that will not devaluate, that will gain value. It's a long-term investment. When you buy a van, well, it's a vehicule, and vehicules devaluate. So you ultimatly end up with less value than you paid for and you will come back to square one money-wise eventualy.

For context, I'm looking at buying a van at around the 35-45k $ mark. At that price point, I wont have anything new, probably between 150k and 250k km on the counter of the vehicule too. I'm looking for already converted van/campers as I wouldn't have the ressources to do the conversion myself. I live in east canada and I need something that's 4 seasons insulated, that influences the cost, too.

So my question to the ones that did the move is; How do you treat, long-term financially speaking, the action of buying a van with the intent of living in it?

The life style, it's bads and its goods does appeal to me. I however would appreaciate an experienced point of view as to how and why it is financially not as bad as buying something that will eventualy dries out in value looks like to be from the exterior in order to be more confident about such a leap.

VanLife,"'91 Previa Brake Pads/Caliper Replacement

Hey guys, first time poster

I have a 1991 Toyota Previa. She's in great condition on the inside, but there are a few problems. I'm still learning how to do maintenance as this is my first vehicle to work on aside from changing oil in my last. I know this is a big bite to start with, but it's the only vehicle I have and no contacts so help would be very welcome.

The problems:

The transmission is buggered and slips out of park when I initially go to move gears, but it sticks once I get it there

The E-break just doesn't work and when it's cold the handle leans up

Grinding noise mainly in the right wheel when braking and also when making sharp turns but only grinding when turning slowly

The radio is out

The AC is also out, but it works when it's warm

The power steering belt needs replacement

The tires need to be balanced


So - my challenge is that I need to replace the brake pads and probably the calipers as well.

Firstly, I am still doing research into replacement but I want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing. What type of tools should I anticipate to use? Is there something I won't be able to do outside of a shop/special tool that is too expensive that regular degular people can't afford?

What should I be looking for when I replace the pads? Such as underlying problems, other things I can check while I'm there.

Keep in mind this is early in my research, so if the questions come off uneducated its because they are! Thank you!

VanLife,"Hello!

My wife, two dogs, and I are about to move into our 1977 VW Camper full time. I am looking at installing a small toilet (preferably a Thetford Porta Potti 335), however, the toilet sits at 12.2"" tall and the only space I have to install a toilet is 12"" tall.  The secondary concern is that the handle to flush the contents into the cassette is mounted on the front of the toilet. This would be blocked by the front of the couch that this would be mounted in. As a result, I'd like to  built a very short wooden box for the top half of the toilet to sit on. The chute from the bowl would then connect to a pipe that directly drops to a holding tank under the bus. All toilets that I've seen that connect directly to a waste holding tank are too tall to fit in the space I have. Thetford's customer support was unable to tell me two bits of information that I'm hoping the folks out here in Redditland can.

First, what is the diameter of the chute?

Second, how far does the chute extend? (Is there enough pipe there to get a coupler on?)

Perhaps, if further explanation is needed, I'd like to connect the top half of this toilet to a short length of pipe via a rubber coupler like this:

https://preview.redd.it/wo971l6jl0161.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd3688e0f3471ac2a8c71efa8011bf3f6f24bd0

Then, the short 3"" pipe would connect to a waste gate mounted horizontally (to separate the bowl from the tank). Basically, the short pipe would act as a second coupler to the ""flushing mechanism"".  This waste gate would have two 3"" pipe fittings rather than a hose fitting. Additionally, the waste gate would be mounted in such a way that the handle would be used from the side rather than from the front. This would look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

From there, it connects to another short 3"" pipe that goes through the floor of the bus and drops into a waste holding tank that can be drained from the outside.

If the theoretical maximum of my PC was say 400 Watts and I had 400 Watts of solar panels on the roof could I conceivably  game indefinitely?

# HUGE VAN 24v electric question /advice...

Hey guys,

Just  starting to do the research on my next van build and ive got an idea of  setup but wanted to get some advice on anything to check/look out for.  Also maybe my research will help others looking for similar.

\-The van will be a huge MAN TGE Supersingle (XLWB XHR L4/H4)

\-I want to go gas free

\-I'm  looking at a 24v set up because I've got a few power hungry  appplicances, (aircon, fridge freezer, invertor cooktop) plus other 24v  benefits (weight, cost, less copper usage)

\-I'm going for Lithium Batteries and plenty of solar

I've speaking to a very helpful guy at Photonic Universe in the UK and my plan is:

As  a rough guide I can get the Iconica unit, 720wh solar and 500ah  Batteries for ¬£3,800. This is a whole heap cheaper than almost any other  setup, especially the Victron options. (They have one 200ah battery for  ¬£2k alone). It's also super easy to stack the batteries if I want to  add another.

My questions are :

**- Best way to use Modern Euro Engine alternator to charge 24v lithium batteries?**

**- Best way to step down 24v to 12v for some 12v appliances like Max Air Fan**

**- What else do I need to think about coming from a 12v setup in current van?**

Also if anyone wanted to know why we are going for such a huge van:

\- Full year round off grid living (from Summers in Greece to Winters in the Alps)

\-  Toy list - 2 x MTB, 1 x small motorbike (Triton Manix 125), 2 x ski  touring kit, 2 x inflatable SUPs, hiking gear, camping gear

\- Inside plan - Rear -  Permanent bed at the back above garage.

\-  Inside plan - Left side - Permanent shower with composting toilet and  'drying room' functionality (heater inlet and the bottom, fan at the  top) - Sink and bit of worktop - sliding door

\-  Inside plan - Right side - Full height slimline fridge freezer -  Induction cooktop and bit of worktop - Small pull out sofa chair bed  thing depending on space and swivel table/counter top

\- Inside plan - Front - Two swivel chairs

This  puts us way above the 3.5t limit, and the MAN TGE Supersingle is rated  to 5t but built using a single rear wheel, which is what I want, and not  a twin.

VanLife,"I lived in my car before (not by choice) and loved it. My goal at the time was to save money to get a apartment before winter. I have one now and hate it. I feel like I feel back into a trap. So I want to do Van life full-time for the next 5 years min. 

I choose 5 years because right now I spend 700$ a month on rent and gas and 5 years is the amount of time I'd need to have living in a Van to save money. 

My budget was $43,000 but after watching Let's Be Use on YouTube I think I might have went to far on the safe side. For the van itself I only wanted to pay 8k but I don't know about cars what so ever. So I don't know if a van is good or bad whenever something is broken or someone says ""only the carburetor is broken everything else is fine!"" So that's my biggest concern picking the wrong van and it breaking down to the point of no repair on the first or second year. 

Everything else below is just additional information I'm not sure if it's needed but better safe than sorry 

How many ppl living in the Van :

Its just me and my cat.

Type of Van I'm thinking about :

 I was thinking about getting a Mercedes Sprinter Van but finding one (good or bad) is hard. I can't find any used on my local facebook marketplace or craigslist. 

Needs I will need for sure : 

A small twin bed space. Storage
Internet. Bathroom and shower. AC/Heater. Kitchen. Security

How I will make money : 

Not planning on leaving my state so I will be working but just living out the van. 

A little more about me :
I don't like the 9 to 5 life so I want to retire using the FIRE retirement plan. So that's putting money into a roth ira until I get the amount I need to retire. So savings and my money are big for me. 

If anything else I'll edit

Both are 120W, but one operates on 120v while the other on 12v.

Watts/Volts=Amps

Amps is how the battery storages power, meaning, the more amps a device needs, more power will draw from the battery, right?

120/12 = 10Amps

120/120 = 1Amp

I understand that I will need to run an inverter to be able to run the 120V fridge, but the power draw from the inverter doesn't justify going for 12v.

VanLife,"Hi all. I just purchased a van that is outfitted with a Vanner 20-1050CUL-DC Ambulance Power Module ([link to manual](https://www.vanner.com/manuals/20-1050CUL-DC.pdf)). This is an inverter/charger/transfer relay. As far as I can tell, it only charges from shore power (not from the alternator). The van itself is wired with several additional 12v outlets, and several 120v AC outlets. These only put out power when the vehicle is running.

The charger in that unit is not optimized to charge LifePO4 batteries, which I would like to use. To that end, I have purchased 100aH battery and Renogy DCC50S DC-DC charger.

I would like to be able to run the 12v and 120v outlets (particularly the 12v) when the van is off. Do I just need a battery selector switch like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Perko-8501DP-Marine-Battery-Selector/dp/B00144B6AE)? Is it that simple?

Oh quick addition: I'm really digging the certainty of having a home, my own space, that I won't get kicked out in case of a catastrophe, that I can take anywhere and everywhere and away if I need to, and that I can rely on being there no matter what. I don't need too much space and always liked smaller living spaces anyway. 

**1) Apart from the purchase and building investment, is monthly living in a van cheaper?**   
I'd have sollars + propane, but I'm talking stuff like car maintenance, internet, water, possible parking fees (I'd mostly do free parking during work weeks), and all that stuff. Would you say, from experience, whether it is cheaper to stay in a van or in a regular home? 

**2)** **Bloody frickin laundry. Like how even what even + related problem: bedding**  
I'm a big fan of wool sweaters, so I'm used to doing hand washing. With a small closet, I'll do a lot of regular daily hand washing and drying so that's okay but what I'm really not a big fan of is doing bedding washing - there's only a single laundromat in my city and they're not exactly common in Europe, where I am and will be based, as far I know. Either way, how are ya'll sleeping :D ? Do you have a regular duvet and two covers that you change and wash and dry together when they both get dirty in a laundromat? Are there any alternatives? It's really silly, I know - but... ya know? I'm okay with a sleeping bag but like... why, if it's not necessary? 

**3) The van size**  
Does anyone for the love of all that's good in the world know what's the maximum length of a van to legally park in a regular parking spot? Maybe I'm just not looking well enough but I can't find a definite answer anywhere. 

**4) Fridge and freezer**  
I am doing a regular fridge and freezer bit. Like there's no question about it. I just wonder if anyone who does have a fridge and freezer in their van has any tips or regrets? Is it worth it? 

**5) A bit unrelated but:** does anyone with their steering wheel on the left side (regular Europe) drove in England (or Malta) where you switch sides? Is it manageable? I have a lot of experience driving on the other side but with the steering wheel where it should be.

We're starting our VanLife project and we've got many questions, perhaps you guys might be able to help us out. 

We live in France and we want to hire somebody to build our van from scratch, but we can't decide which van would be the best...  
\- ***Would you be able to advise us on which van model could be a good idea?*** We're looking for a model that is not too old but not brand new, and that we may find it here in Europe (US brands are not so easy to find). Probably a model from the 00's. Also we'd like to be able to park in a regular parking spot (around 5 meters, is it?). Lastly, we need to be able to stand up inside it, so either a van that's high already, or that we may change the roof.

\- ***What would be the maximum length of the van to be able to park in the street?*** We heard it's 5 meters, but plenty of models are around 5,2 meters, so we wonder if somebody out there has experience with vans that are a bit longer in regards to parking in the street.

\- ***Buying a van that has no side windows and later adding one, could it be a bad idea?*** Like, is it very expensive? Or perhaps it's not really advised for some other reason? We mean... is it doable? :P

\- ***Buying a van that is not very high and adding a high-top, could it be a bad idea?*** We know it's possible, but would it add many constraints, like isolation problems, or not being able to park in the majority of private indoor parking lots?

\- ***Do you know anyone (or a company) in France that works with van conversion?*** If yes, how can we contact them? We know it's a bit of a stretch to ask that, but who knows... perhaps we get lucky ;)

In the summer I loved tipping away at the van in the long summer evenings and escaping at the weekends to places I've always wanted to visit but without the accommodation costs and the choice to move freely to different locations!! 

This time it's going to be different though..I've learned my lessons from previous builds and I know exactly what I want for the new van and I want to maximize my budget. So sitting looking out the window I thought right.... instead of binge-watching Netflix and aimlessly scrolling through Facebook, this is where my spare time will go, and come next summer I will thank myself and give myself a pat on the back for making this decision now!!

From my own experience, there is nothing worse than trying to design and plan as you are building.  As the famous saying goes - 

# By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail

Maybe we can start a planning thread and share ideas of what areas we are honing in on when planning our build. e.g how to save money, where to buy the best quality parts etc.

VanLife,"Hey guys. I'm looking at purchasing a (second hand) van, to be kitted out as a campervan, though I also want to be able to use it for work as and when needed (Not often) and because of this I was thinking of creating a mounting system, that means interior units (The shelves / cupboards with the sink and hob, bed, that sort of thing) aren't actually permanently secured to the van, instead having a mounting system (Using baton, steel, linkage and lynch pins) that is secured. When camping, install units and secure in place. When needing it for work, the units can be unclipped / unattached from the mounts on the floor, emptying the back of the van minus the floor mounts.

Anyhow, my question isn't about that, it's about this:

I have been wanting a Toyota Hiace, as they are the ideal size; not too big, not too small. However, I've just learnt that you CANNOT stand in the back of them. Camper versions with fibreglass high tops do exist, but I do not want one of these (As transporting items via roof will be necessary at times)

What are some vans of similar size, yet allow you to stand in the back? I am bang-on 6-foot.

Here is a Toyota Hiace, for reference. They are 4.8 metre / 15.75 foot total length.

VanLife," So I am trying to decide which type of vehicle to get for a certain lifestyle, and really - it comes down to parking.

The lifestyle I am aiming for is this:

* Work remotely, but when I do I require a lot of power and solid wifi, so...
* Airbnbs with month-long discounts when I get freelance work...
* I get to these places in a vehicle.
* When I don't have any work, or in between jobs, I want to be as off-grid as possible for sleeping warm, eating, and doing a poo.
   * Working on a laptop, and showers are secondary as I will try to rely on external places for that.
   * A mix of urban camping and nature. (country, villages, towns, cities)
* I would like to use the vehicle for other stuff in and around the areas I travel to.
* I really want to be able to take the same vehicle to both the north of Finland and even down to Morocco.
   * lift kit and all-terrain tires (maybe 4x4 if something is cheap enough)
* Want to spend as little time in campsites as possible

For reference, I've hired a Ducato L2H2 (Promaster) for 3 nights and found places to park in most places - but I only tried a few places in the UK, and idk about leaving it there for days/weeks at a time? also, it's hard to tell what the deal is in Europe or Morocco or Further east - I've been googling for ages.

So really, paired with Airbnbs, I feel can do some of this in the back of an estate as long as I spend most my time at airbnbs. The minimum to do all of it would be a VW transporter (t4, t5), but they are really expensive and I'd need to add features to it anyway. A Delica might even cut it, but they might be as high as a van anyway with all the 4x4 suspension stuff. But the best thing for comfort, experience, AND cost would be a self converted Ducato/Promaster at H1L1 or H2L2.

If I don't plan to work properly out of the van, I can just plan for enough electricity to run a fridge and heater, which will cut costs down.

The only reason I can think of to not get a Ducato/Promaster is the parking situation at AirBnbs. Some places offer free parking, but I messaged a few at random and not all have room for a full-on van.

**TL;DR** I really need advice on this... I'm trying to manage my expectations!

1. Does anyone mix up van dwelling and Airbnb-ing (villages, towns and cities)? What do you do with your van if you don't need it for a month? Would parking it elsewhere but close be much of a problem? I guess it is different everywhere, but can most European places be generalized?
2. What type of vehicle is best for this? Estate, Transporter, Delica, Low roof Ducato, High roof Ducato.
3. Will getting a low roof Ducato/Promaster make much difference to parking than a high roof version or are they both as compromised as each other?

I've always wanted a dog but as growing up I didn't have the best luck with pets. I have avoided getting a dog due to finances and the worry of travelling and not being able to take the dog or dogs. 

I know you can get pet passports but I worry about quarantines and the costs of this? Does the animal have to be quarantined every time they visit a new country? How long for and is that pricey? And how often do pet passports have to be renewed? 

My finances should be changing dramatically and I'll be saving over the next year or two, I won't be living my van life for a good few years yet.

Im either going to use spray foam or small peices of wood to make the floor flat before I put down a big board on top and some cheap linoleum to finish it off.   
Any suggestions or dont dos? Is the foam thing a bad idea? it would decay slower than wood and id just sand the top off to make it flat.

I've never been to New Mexico or know anyone who knows it well. But I've been told I would like Santa Fe, so I figured I'd hit that at some point.

VanLife,"I would have thought sooo...since it‚Äôs running 24/7 to keep my cider really cold as I like them ;) That Norcold DC-490 fridge is a masterpiece in my home on wheels and it draaaaaaws.... :/

But seriously electronic gadgets are the worst, they binge on electrons stored in your battery bank !!

And once you get into #vanlife you start to count the ins and the outs of those little electrons that you harvested from those sun‚Äôs photons!

I talking about my collection of 500+ movies collection that I stored in a HDD drive that I like to watch on my hungry retina MacBook!

When I first started #vanlife a year ago, I was testing my system, I have a 285W solar panel with a 12v 220Ah battery bank driven by Victron controller which is by the way top notch ;) I soon realize that I had to make some concession  about using light at night, charging cellphone, proper extraction fan speed and making sure nothing was staying idling and wasting power...

But also after some more fine tuning, I realized that not only the type of equipment I used were taxing my autonomy but also the way I used then!

Let‚Äôs go back to my collection on movie that is stored on a HDD external.

You know at home you would just plug all your gear together so you can watch a movie, who really cares of counting the power usage? That‚Äôs just going to be a couple of dime more on tout utility bill at the end de of the month, eh who cares about that!?
 

Well I did had to care about it last winter, I live in canada, so during winter the sun is well.....not very high in the sky, and last winter, my first winter #vanlifing, I was running out of cold cider ::

So I find out those little HDD drive they spin sooo fast 7000rpm+, that‚Äôs going to spin for 143minutes while you watch you watch Tom Hanks  talking with Wilson cast away on his island and that is going to suck up 10% of your battery capacity just fit 2 hours of entertainment !!


Ok ok so you say, well Simon why are your talking all that crap about Tom Hanks beating up battery bank?

Well! I just found out a solution and now my cider can keep cold, my Planar heater can run all day long and it‚Äôs really simple!

If you wanna be easy on those little electron your stored all day in your battery bank why don‚Äôt you just flash-copy-paste the movie you just wanna watch right on to your SSD internal hard drive on your MacBook and BAM voil√†!  No more watts guzzler eating up your battery

I went through a phase last year where I watched a lot of VanLife YouTube channels.

I found that series super interesting because most of the vanlife content I was consuming was primarily America based (outside of Kombi Life). 

I started digging and noticed that both channels don't have the other under ""featured channels"" on their YouTube profiles anymore. I thought that was weird because they did spend six months traveling together in foreign countries. I checked Instagram and Trent &amp; Allie follow The Nomadic Movement (however, T&amp;A does follow 2000+ accounts), but TNM does not follow them back, which I found weird. I tried to find videos or blog posts or literally anything that could indicate them having a fallout, but I couldn't find anything.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your tips and tricks for sanitation?

&amp;#x200B;

Charging devices, what are your go to- budget friendly options?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to move into my vehicle soon due to realizing it is what makes sense for my current situation. I haven't been able to figure out keeping an apartment or buy a house, I haven't been able to figure out relationships, regardless if they can keep a place or not, and all in all it makes me feel like I have to,  if only for me, move into a vehicle for at  least a short while as a sort of self discovery sort of thing. The questions above are my biggest issues with doing this with an old '89 Bronco I probably will have to trade in at some point or just scrap for some other beater.

I'm ok with anything that can run more than two hours without feeling like it would die at red lights, braking, or slow downs, I'm ok with seasonal work that will help keep me afloat until the next working season, and I'm  ok with knowing that I will have to re-figure out everything I know I have ever done to make sure this will work. In the end I want enough time to play my guitar, record music, and do what I need to for a basic income.

In the future I'm looking into doing crafts like bracelets, dream-catchers, wire trees, pretty much anything that's an easily transportable craft to help grow a sort of self-sustaining business, but I understand I need to start somewhere for income, and have found most ""work remotely"" jobs require some sort of modem/non 4/5g connection, so I'm unsure how to try to make sure income is a sustainable thing. When it comes to sanitation I know that a portable shower and a shovel can do wonders, but I was thinking maybe there are other, equally budget friendly things to do to help tackle hygienic things like showers, basic washing, etc. I may be able to look into. Charging things has to come hand in hand with a combination of drive time with the engine running, solar power from the rig and position you happen to be parked in, and also being able to plug into grid power, and I was hoping someone would be more well versed than me in having answers.

I obviously can‚Äôt keep both but don‚Äôt know what the safer choice is. The G20 is in no way pretty it has lots of superficial dents and missing bolts. Had to have some of the sheet metal replaced on the inside floor due to rust and there‚Äôs more rust underneath where the frame mounts to the bumper and on the wheel wells. It‚Äôs at 140,000 miles and passed inspection (after the rust on the floor was repaired) with no issues and made a 250 mile trip to bring it home very smoothly. Mechanically, it runs great. Previous owner was a friend who put a lot of money into the engine. I like the fact that this van is particularly long as it provides comfortable living space, I just worry that the rust may be its downfall. As for the Ford Econoline it has 75,000 original miles (know for a fact it‚Äôs not rolled over) and it‚Äôs been kept in a garage for the last 20 years. Superficially this van is perfect and the owner is actually a mechanic himself and assures me that it runs flawlessly, he only ever used it to make trips to golf in the Carolinas and come back to the northeast. That said it struggled to start when I checked it out. It‚Äôs a shorter van with a little less clearance but much taller.

I have been going through Facebook Marketplace like a madman. I find this one van that sticks out. 1999 Ford Econoline Sports mobile for $1,400 and only 86k miles! Ooooooh boy. The issue is there is only one picture, but the thing looks mint. The description said its not the listers item, but her sisters and you need to email her. 

So i saw this 2 days ago at 11pm-ish at night, with it posted ""3 hours ago"" about an hour drive from me in Hartford, CT I email stating that im interested, want to check it out this weekend, and if there's more pics and does anything need fixing?

Yesterday morning i get the reply!!! We are in!!! She stays she's stationed in Nebraska and got promoted, will be transferred to Alaska. The van needs to be gone by the 24th, hence the low price, its always been garage kept, promises nothing wrong and its still in her garage. Still no new pics though 

I opened the email only 30min after its delivery, and replied super fast too. Im interested to buy, can come this weekend! Now here's where it gets weird.... a minute after my reply i go back into my Saved list on marketplace to admire the ONE picture, but it now says SOLD... Hmmm ok, maybe as she was replying to me, someone came with cash ASAP. I keep checking the listing throughout yesterday to see if pictures added, but still says SOLD

I wake up today to an email.... Now she mentions she works with Ebay and its at a shipping company. Doesnt mention what company. In order for her to get paid, i have to inspect and drive the car at least 5 days. She wants name, address and phone number to register me into Ebay, where they will contact me and deliver the van in 3 days. I'm not entirely sure how the van went from her ""garage"" to the shipper like that but ok.... ANYWAYS she did send some more photos, inside, engine bay, side view, etc

I'm sitting in the parking lot before work, and go to look at the listing again and admire the posting again. ITS NOT THERE.

I used to sell a few things on Craigslist locally, and since you give your email, you always get those scammers saying they are out of town and can give you a check once you give them info...

This is really something I want to do, with winter coming up this could be a project to get my hands on.

Now I'm back home in The Netherlands and reading up on what it takes to get, own and convert a van. I instantly run into a few obstacles:

* I live in the city center of one of the top 3 biggest cities of my country. To say there is a parking shortage is an understatement. Parking in my street is only allowed for a maximum of 2 hours. Other areas nearby allow a maximum stay of 3 days.

* There are some designated streets for parking which allow you to park an RV for up to a month. Some areas are even free. Takes me 15 minutes of cycling so there's not much I can carry when it comes to tools. I don't own another vehicle.

The option above would be the best option but this comes with a big downside: the lack of electricity. I can't see myself hooking up a generator on that parking lot next to other cars. I've thought of building, sawing and cutting all components from home, carry them a few floors down in the elevator, and put them in the van but this seems impractical.

VanLife,"I've spent awhile brainstorming floorplans for my Transit Connect cargo van (long wheel base). I bought it last year with the goal of creating a mini-camper that I will take to the southwestern United States for several months each winter. The goal is pretty ambitious: I want to be comfortable inside a VERY tiny space.

The last conversion I did was a 7x14' cargo trailer so there's a LOT less space with the Connect. Losing standing room is painful enough, but I don't want to make too many compromises. Most of my time will be spent outside the van, but when inside it needs to be cozy for both working and sleeping. Here were my requirements:

* comfortable chair with armrests and enough legroom to lounge
* laptop desk at typing height
* extra seating for at least one person
* kitchen counter space accessible from both seats
* closet rod for hanging clothes
* twin XL length memory foam bed (I'm tall)
* cassette toilet (doesn't need to be accessible from inside)
* storage area for food, cooler, water tanks, power station, etc.
* storage space for folding mountain bike and 2000w gas generator

Believe it or not, I was able to make everything fit after calculating the exact size of everything and modeling it on paper (see diagrams below). The problem is that there's only about 1"" of tolerance in any direction to build the platforms and shelving. I've used wood in the past, but traditional 2x4 and plywood construction will add too much extra bulk to the floorplan.

80/20 framing looks like a possible solution, but I have no idea how to estimate the cost of building with aluminum. I've also considered using standard wire shelving like I use in my garage and just cut the poles down to the correct height. What would be the best materials to use for construction when every inch is important? My budget is $1000.

VanLife," Hello friends!

I am an aspiring van dweller. My life has aligned itself for me to take this step so I would have to start looking for something to build in. I don't necessarily need answers but rather opinions so that I can make my decision.

These are the ""locked"" van requirements:

1. Pretty tall dude at 6.4... I can't really change that and I'd like to be able to comfortably stand.
2.  I am a software developer and I want to keep doing that moving forward. This locks me for a permanent desk and a monitor besides the laptop.
3. For ease I would like a fixed shower and bed. 
4. I'm an expat living in UK - I am not sure where I will actually travel and for how long, but I am sure a lot of the time I will be parked in UK somewhere.

 My 2 separate concerns are:

1. Since I plan to visit Europe, should I look for left  or right side steering wheel?
2. What van models I should be looking at?

Now I know the Mercedes sprinter is a great option, but could I save some money with a different brand? Or does it even matter? Honestly I have no idea what budget I should allocate for my van but it would be great to keep it as cheap as possible with a used van and converting it myself

The shore-power (Campsite hookup) socket is fed to a single 3-pin socket (UK). 
There was a plug in that socket that leads to the input of an RCD, Which then has 2 outputs - Both go to a double socket - One above for plugging stuff in on the countertop etc. and another underneath with a battery charger connected to it.

*we have been saving our money for a long time so we will be able to buy something nice (not crazy expensive though,  we‚Äôre saving for colleges too)
*we don‚Äôt want to build or re-build. We want something all set up for us. 
*would be nice to sleep 4, but not a deal breaker.

VanLife,"Hello, I have been on a mission to do a van conversion for about a year now. I am a full-time employee and I love my job, it‚Äôs cushy BUT I‚Äôm an adventurer at heart. staying pinned down at a 8-5 job isn‚Äôt fulfilling to me. However, I have the opportunity to move to TX to help start a new branch. It would be in the next couple of years and I do find it a very appealing opportunity. I am also constantly planning my escape from this life. I would like to start a van conversion business or entrepreneurial escapade before my 40‚Äôs (I am 26). 

Here‚Äôs the deal: I close on a house next week where I will have a shop space. I saw a craigslist ad for a 1999 Dodge 3500 high top van for $3500. It has 240k+ miles and he promises it‚Äôs been well taken care of and runs like a charm. I believe (I know how sketchy craigslist can be BUT not everything on there is a scam). My aunt/uncle are willing to drive out with me to pick it up. I am going to suggest to the man that we meet at a mechanic shop to be inspected on my dollar. I don‚Äôt have a whole lot saved up right now since I have recently paid off recent debt. I do have enough to cover the van + inspection + tax, etc. But I‚Äôll be really tight the next couple of months.

(My plan for TX is to keep my house and live in a campervan since it is a driveable distance and cost of living is high in TX)

I am just looking for some advice and I appreciate any that you‚Äôre willing to give. This is a big purchase for me as I have no one to fall back on financially if I get into any sort of trouble.

VanLife,"Hi all,   
I'm looking for some advice on putting a tile floor in our Ford Transit van camper conversion. We are trying to make our van as low VOC as possible, so flooring like vinyl and linoleum are not options for us. We tried hardwood and had a horrible experience with scratching, so that leaves us with tile.

We plan to put 12""x8 inch tile pieces on top of a Ditra uncoupling membrane on top of a well-framed 3/4"" plywood subfloor. We can use a flexible mortar between the plywood and the Ditra, but not in between the Ditra and the tile, per their instructions. We will also add silicone to the grout to allow for some flexing between tiles. 

We're concerned about cracking and the tile floor shifting all together over the Ditra if we're parked on an incline.

What do y'all think? Have you heard of anyone successfully tiling their van? Does anyone have any ideas how much a Transit van flexes? We're not planning to off-road or even travel full time in it, but we'll obviously drive it some. We're hoping that between the uncoupling membrane, the flexible grout, and the small-ish tile size, we'll be safe from cracking or shifting in the floor.",Tile Floor in Van?,1,False,catlong4444

I decided to say fuck it and commit to getting a van so I'd love some advice.

My plan is to get something like a Hiace or a Selica but open to suggestions. The price for one of those in AUS can be around 4-7k for a good one which isn't too bad and what I'm aiming for. I'm going to just use it as a weekender and climbing trips so don't need anything fancy. 

In terms of the build, I've been looking at things like Nomad Campers or Vango fit-outs. They have custom-built options or pre-built. Does anyone know what are the ranges of this kind of things? I don't really have the tools or the ability to do it myself which is unfortunate.

VanLife,"As I've posted previously, we are building a van that is not specifically ""live in"". We just haven't made up our minds on the entire van life idea. That being said, we are currently moving into the insulation phase of our build. We are planning on leaving 3 of the 4 windows, including our rear window making a total of 5 windows uninsulated. My question is- Is there really a point to heavily insulate the floors and walls of the van?   


My understanding is the van works like a cooler, keeping the heat/cool in. But if we are leaving so much area uninsulated, isn't that heat/cool just going to exit at these areas? So the other insulation is rendered pointless? I'm not saying I'm right, I'm just looking for some feedback because I don't want to waste the time/money to insulate my floors with 1"" foam and make sure every nook and cranny is filled. Regardless I'm going to put SOME insulation in, whether it be for noise retention or energy purposes. Any feedback welcome.

VanLife,"Hi.  I'm just beginning the process of converting a 2018 ProMaster 159.  There is a massive cornucopia of information online that shows how to do all sorts of stuff.  I'm pretty competent in construction and so while I'm confident that I can come up with my own methods, I've definitely spent countless hours watching all of the variations that people have done for subflooring, insulation, soundproofing, etc.

My question here is about soundproofing.  RattleTrap seems to be the most common material used, though I've researched a variety of other options including paints that are supposed to absorb sound.  But I'm wondering if anybody can tell me specifically what the goal of the soundproofing actually is?  I think it's one of those questions that seems really obvious until you try and answer it.

Are you trying to keep sound from the inside escaping to the outside?  Trying to keep sound from the outside entering the inside?  Trying to keep the general vibrations of the van's metal frame from making noise?  Or just trying to create a slightly ""deader"" sound chamber within the van?  Or possibly some combination therein?

To follow that up, has anybody ever seen a video or a website that actually does any scientific testing of a before and after.  I've seen many videos where somebody will apply RattleTrap to the interior sides of their van, then they'll tap the side without the RattleTrap and then the side with it and generally look to the camera and exclaim: ""wow, way quieter!"".  But the fact is, that's a pretty non-scientific test.  You could affix just about anything to a piece of metal and its capacity to resonate sound is going to be massively diminished.  A simple piece of cardboard taped to metal can demonstrate that.

So I'm curious if anyone has actually used a proper decibel meter to measurably demonstrate what the purpose of RattleTrap is actually for.  I'm not saying it does NOT work or do something, but I DO have thoughts that it could also be one of those things that somebody made a video of, then others started copying it, and now it's just something people use regardless of its effectiveness because they've seen others do it.

It's not super expensive and so I don't mind adhering it.  But I'm just genuinely curious if anybody has done any kind of real analysis of its effectiveness within a campervan conversion?  I've built music studios before and generally speaking, the soundproofing we do isn't so much to prevent sound from escaping (though I suppose it helps some), but rather its to change the acoustics within the space itself.  If you were recording a lot of acoustic music then you might want a lot of wooden sounds.  If you're recording heavy metal riffs or something, you'd definitely not want that.   

**tl;dr: All conversion videos use RattleTrap.  Has anybody ever shown scientifically the difference that it makes when it's used vs. when it's not used?  Also, soundproofing is a very vague term that can mean a lot of things so what is the specific purpose of applying the RattleTrap?**",Technical questions about RattleTrap - Has anybody ever scientifically tested the effectiveness of it?

The agent explained no that converted vans are totally covered by their policy, with the caveat that we have to have a detailed breakdown of everything we have added to the van. This evidence would be receipt and photos of the build.

Good Sam is backed by Progressive. We came to renew our policy. Guess what? Not covered, only manufactured RVs are covered.

DO Not Use!!!?

Any recommendations on actually valid VanLife insurance policies would be greatly appreciated.",(warning) Don't use Good Sam for VanLife insurance,1,False,YungMuni85

I was lucky enough to buy a van from jucyusa, linked [here](https://www.jucyusa.com/our-vehicles/jucy-mini-rv-rental/jucy-trailblazer/); 

They call it a trailblazer but essentially it's just a repurposed dodge caravan. I really love it, and am planning on using it for weekend trips and maybe slightly longer trips to pursue my sport. 

It comes with a solar panel on the top, an inverter, and a separate battery that powers a USB port, overhead light, fridge in the back, and some other odds and ends. However, as of now I have no way of actually seeing how much power I have stored, how much I am using, any of the essentials. 

I am looking for a display like some I have seem on some of you all's builds that looks good, futuristic and sleek might be a stretch to hope for but at the least something that I can work with. On top of that, if anybody has some very general pointers as to how to install it (even if this means pointing me in the direction of a link, or even what to Google to get that answer) I would really appreciate it.

* Heating for winter
* Cooling for summer (Fan installed)
* Really good insulation that works well in all four seasons
* Space for stuff (suitcases)
* Electric cooler or fridge/freezer
* Microwave
* Safe vehicle
* Possible to stealth camp
* Access to electricity even when the car isn‚Äôt running

VanLife,"Hey All! I‚Äôve decided I want to buy a Transit Connect but there‚Äôs a lot of common talk I see here that worries me, even though I think my use of the Van is different than most. The couple (related) aspects that concern me are: stealth and theft.

I‚Äôm planning on taking it out for 2-3 weeks at a time, eventually visiting the 48 states. While on the road, I‚Äôll be working my 8hr/day job remotely.

I‚Äôm not doing anything fancy. In my van, I‚Äôm looking to build a bed, a dog kennel, a minimal/collapsible desk, and a space to store my cooler and kitchen supplies. I‚Äôd also love an ARB awning with a screen room.

I plan on staying overnight on free public land, stores like Walmart on long travel days, or preferably an actual campground. During the day while I‚Äôm working, if my overnight site doesn‚Äôt have sufficient internet, I‚Äôd move into or close to a town and park somewhere legally.

Based on my description and use case, when I‚Äôm searching for the right van, would you say stealth is of major concern? Could it be a silver connect rather than white? And extra window? The awning and fan not hidden or disguised?

Should I be worried about theft if I opt for something less stealthy than a white, no window Connect? Seems like a lot of people stay in neighborhoods(sometimes sketchy), but I‚Äôm out on more of a nature seeing adventure and don‚Äôt see myself in these areas.

My partner is buying her first van for conversion. She's picked out a 2011 e150 from a local dealership. It runs good and the carfax is fairly clean, no major issues. Does have some mild damage at the rear but it just looks like a dent.

What's a fair price for this vehicle? (State is Indiana if that makes a difference). We're both pretty new to van stuff so I'm not expecting to get the best deal in the world, but want to make sure we're not getting totally taken advantage of. Would be really grateful for any advice

VanLife,"I'm just getting started building out a 2018 ProMaster.  Really looking forward to the project!

Of course I've seen probably many of the same YouTube channels that all of you have seen and there are several videos that talk about your van getting broken into or worse, it getting broken into and then stolen altogether.

I haven't seen any of those channels talking about GPS Trackers.  They're so cheap these days and while you DO have to pay for a service agreement, isn't that a pretty cheap no-brainer given what you stand to lose if the vehicle is stolen?  I definitely plan to install one and to pay for the service that comes with it.  I don't think $200 - $300 annually is a whole lot of money given what you stand to lose.

Do other people use these?  And if not, why do you not?  I'm pretty genuinely curious - especially if there are some known problems with them that make them not worth the cost.  Is there perhaps a different option for getting the same outcome that I might not be familiar with?

For those people who DO have them installed and who do pay for the service (or I suppose just those with an opinion on this), do you think it's wiser to have some kind of a sign disclosing that the van has a tracking unit installed?  I feel like they can be pretty well hidden in a van, certainly well enough where you'd really have to tear the thing apart to find one of them given how small they are.  So my thinking is that if a would-be car thief KNEW that the vehicle was going to be tracked, they might be less likely to steal it.  Of course conversely, they would know to look for it if they DID steal it and if they found it then that's going to make recovery all but impossible.

So just wondering if people had thoughts on all of that?

**TL;DR:**

* **Do you have/use a GPS tracker in your van and pay for the service?**
* **If no, why not?  / Is there a better option?**
* **Should you make it obvious (via a sign or the like) that the van has a GPS tracker in it?  Why or why not?**","GPS Trackers - Is everybody using these? If not, why? And should you try to disclose to a would-be thief that the van is being tracked?",1,False,kl0

I have a Private mailbox set up already, but what to do about physical address?

1) I can't just set a mailbox as an address - that would be risky and probably it's not even allowed

2) I can get a NV driver license by staying in motel/campground, but then what to do afterwards? What address should be there afterwards? The campground address or Private Mailbox or what?

First I would like to say thanks to this community for helping us successfully complete our van conversion and live the van life! There were many helpful tips and tricks we found here. 

My husband and I are selling our beloved 2014 144' Mercedes Sprinter Van conversion. It was completed in May 2020 after 8 months of us building it. We really put everything we had into our beloved van! We lived in it for 4 months, and then our circumstances changed and we are back in a house. 

Who is this van good for? It is perfect for 1-2 people who want to live and travel off-grid where ever they feel, while being able to work remotely. You will have all the conveniences of home like a full kitchen and bathroom in a 144‚Ä≤ Sprinter van complete with a rustic wooden design to it.

This van conversion is 100% ready to go. All you need to do is move your belongings in and drive away into your new vanlife!

I will then have a couple of 80/20 bars run across the van wall to wall and then something like wood slates run perpendicular across for a surface on which to put the mattress. Maybe plywood, but something reasonably light.

My first question is does anyone have any good examples of a van build like this? I've found a few. Many are really complicated which I'm not looking to do. I will have a fixed bed with a garage underneath. 

Secondly, what size of 80/20 would be a strong enough to support this? Is 1x1 really strong enough to support a two-person bed? What have other people used? 

Also what size bolts and rivet nuts are folks using when doing this sort of bed mount?

Some examples of this would be great. Most of what I'm finding, like I said, is convertible, non-fixed stuff. Thanks a bunch!",What size rail should I use to mount my floating bed?,1,False,dskippy

VanLife,"Hi from the PNW!

I'm a fairly new lurker to r/VanLife, but I wanted to introduce my rig, especially since I've seen some questions around older vans here.

About 13 years ago, I purchased a 1989 Ford E-350 conversion van with 116k on the clock.  My wife and I have had an on going debate on how this van came to be.  We think it was a husband &amp; wife settling/compromising because this van came loaded with the options.  It has a 460 (7.5L) V-8, with the towing package and all the power options.  It's a beast that will do some amazing burnouts.  Yet, the interior is this super soft rose (pink) interior with frilly accents that seem to be in stark contrast.  The only option that I can find that wasn't checked was the power reclining bench in the rear.  

For us (and our friends), we lovingly refer to it as ""**The Bacon Wagon**"" (BW)

We purchased it to tow our race car &amp; trailer and also give us a place to chill at the track for the double header weekends.  We would even use it to ""camp"" overnight at the track when it was permitted.  Towing the car and trailer was no problem for this rig, but parking was another matter.  I'm pretty sure that the Titanic had a better turn radius than my wagon.  In a normal cul-de-sac, it takes a 3 point turn to get back out.  I still break out in a cold sweat when I think about having to back into a tight place with the car trailer hitched up.

 For a few years, it was our weekend toy hauler during the summer.  I'll admit, BW sat much more than it drove.  We did use the wagon for road bike races and such as well as hauling supplies for home projects.

Moving forward a couple of years, we've got a couple kiddos now.  The van was a novelty and used rarely for a number of years.  Then 2020 hit and we've been trying to figure out activities that we can do as a family yet maintain the distance need to be safe.  To add to the complexity of kids, we added a dog to to the fam as well in 2019, so space was a deciding factor as well.  So.. time to really dust off the Bacon Wagon!

This summer was a focus on updating/refreshing the Bacon Wagon as we did more road trips &amp; camping.  This van has been a blessing and a curse on that front.  This platform existed forever, so the basic parts are usually plentiful and cheap, but because Gran-Ville (the company that did the conversion) went out of business, there are some custom parts which I've had to source ""equivalents"" or even 3d print my own in some cases.  

Everything about this van is a beast though.  It's got coolers galore - Oil cooler, Trans oil cooler, A/C condensor, and a radiator all compete for air flow in.  Want to change the coolant?  Just ignore the funny looks as you buy 7 gallons.  Oh, replace the trans fluid, that, don't mind me as I buy 3 gallons of Merc 5.  Fill up on gas?  Which tank first, but don't be surprised at a $100 bill (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has two fuel tanks).

In the last year or so, I've:

* replaced the alternator
* replaced the fuel tank sector valve (common issue)
* new water pump &amp; coolant flush
* new power steering &amp; lines
* replaced the bushings
* added a damper for the steering
* rebuilt the front &amp; rear A/C system, converting it over to R134a.  
* New blower motor
* Rebuilt some of the Gran-Ville team's wiring in the engine bay
* Replaced the VCR with a 2nd battery, isolator, 500w invertor &amp; added additional power sockets
* Updated stereo with new speakers &amp; amp for the front speakers
* Replaced a host of sensors &amp; valves (idle air control, MAP, etc..)
* New shocks, tires &amp; alignment
* Refinishing the wood trims
* replacing the plastic covers over the interior screws (had to special order the cap covers)
* and a host of other smaller things too 

The Bacon Wagon has been a fun little project that the family has loved taking on the road, and I wanted to share all of the 80's glory with the group.

Enjoy!

She's does not listen to me so if I let her roam free when I'm chilling at a campsite, she would sadly be gone into the woods. :/ I would hate to keep her cooped up in the van all the time or on the leash/lead otherwise.

VanLife,"There are a few places that I looked to find my first van. There are the obvious places but I figured I would link a few and give my two cents on them. 

[Craigslist.org](https://Craigslist.org) \- Obvious right? A good place to look locally, however, you have to run searches on each city/state you want to look in and are limited to what is available there. 

Facebook - I guess they have a marketplace and some have searched there, but, well I do not like Facebook, so good luck to those who are searching there. 

[carfax.com](https://carfax.com) \- This is where I actually found my van. I was able to search by the year, make and mileage, which was very important to me. Plus once I found something I did like, I could see its carfax report to ensure it was a good buy. I searched all over the country to find something. I highly recommend this, do not just look in your backyard, I was able to find a great deal on a used van with very low mileage and turned out to be a Promaster with Diesel, a very rare find. Be willing to travel to get your van and you could find a diamond in the ruff. 

[www.iaai.com](https://www.iaai.com) \- This is a vehicle action site, which a lot of companies use. If you are willing to get something with a bit of body damage or have a way to repair bigger body damage, this place is gold for you. There are a lot of Amazon Prime vehicles here, that get ""totalled out"" by their insurance due to some minor cosmetic dings and dents. I would have bought from here if it wasn't for finding something very good at carfax. The best part about this site, is the van are pretty darn cheap.

VanLife,"So im building my set up now in a Nissan NV Cargo Van. I just finished up a bathroom and am moving on to the kitchen. I have enough room for a 4.5 cubic foot fridge with the kitchenette set I picked up. The kitchenette runs on propane. I'm a pretty handy person but never worked with electrical. Well except for the one week I did and got electrocuted twice lol. So electric and me aren't friends. Anyway I'm looking into lithium ion battery's to power the set up. I'm just not sure how to go about it. Ideally I'd have the fridge running and If possible a microwave from time to time.

VanLife,"So I went on a 45 day long van trip out west this summer. It got cut short so I went home back east and decided to chill at home. After 1 week I felt like I was back in the ole' rut - bored, nothing to do, browsing the internet. I somehow felt no elation for my nice bed or my spacious desk. It just seemed dull. My energy level sank pretty low too.

So I headed out on the road and I'm back in the mountains (on the east coast.) I bit the bullet and used hip camp since there's not tons of free stuff out here. I am staying at a horse farm for 20 bucks a night! It's really spacious and relatively inexpensive. I am surprised how much I am enjoying things! 

Immediately I became more focused, happier. My meditation, yoga, reading and other healthy habits immediately fell into place too. It's like I'm just meant to be doing this. I have no idea why!

I met a guy (55 y.o.) who had been living on a boat for the past 5 years and he was telling me how he feels that wanderlust all the time. When I told him I had been thinking about ""just being reasonable"" in life he said don't do it! He looked like he was having fun. Was really validating to meet someone else like me who feels drawn towards alternative lifestyles. 

I know that only time will tell the whole story. Maybe I become a part time van lifer. I've never been through a winter! But something about this freedom, this focus, I don't think I'll be able to shake.

VanLife,"Hello I will try to make this brief but me and my g/f have over the past few years gone on some pretty fun long road trips but always rented a full size SUV to do it like an Expedition.  Since all our vacation plans have been totally destroyed this year due to the pandemic we were talking and thought maybe we should look into getting a Van to do these trips instead of renting a SUV.  I am totally on board growing up my family went through 2 conversion vans an 84 Ford E150 low top and a 94 Ford E150 high top which was my personal favorite.  Sadly my dad decided to do the cash for clunkers and traded it in for an Altima Hybrid *gross* which he later admitted was a huge mistake.  It only had 100k even and was garaged its whole life and nearly in mint condition only some accent lights were burnt out which I wanted to replace with LEDs for them but they sold it before I could.

Anyway flash forward to now me and my g/f built a brand new house at the end of last year and got a 3rd car garage in hopes that we would have a 3d vehicle for fun activities.  Originally we were going to get something like a fun 2 door coupe type car but then decided we needed something with utility since we wanted to explore more of Florida's nature like kayaking and biking on trails and such both our cars are not really suited for that type of work.  We both have Lincoln MKZs and hers has the large panoramic glass roof so no roof rack can go on hers.

I would prefer a Ford van since that's what we had when I was growing up and I tend to know more about them than anyone really should and I would prefer a low top so it would fit in the garage in the 3rd stall.  I have been searching on craigslist and cars.com and autotrader.com and am having a hard time finding a low top Ford conversion van.  And if I do find one they are almost always either abused or have a wheelchair lift or if they are nice and exactly what I am looking for they are gone immediately.  Are there any other sites out there that I should include on my searches? Any other suggestions to look out for?  I really appreciate it!

VanLife,"Hi there! I hope this is okay to post here since this situation is based on me potentially buying a fifth wheel toy hauler... I know, I know, it's not a van (though I was THIS close to buying one last year), I'm sorry! :P But I'm trying to gather as much info as I can and I figured I would post this here since this sub is great for like-minded folks like myself. I know everyone won't be able to answer all of my questions (some are more specific to RV subs) but I really appreciate any and all of your thoughts!

\_\_\_\_\_

So let me start from the beginning: I‚Äôve had this dream for longer than I can remember. Recently, for about a year, I was living in Portland, OR. Due to the pandemic, I lost my job and my lease ended. I couldn‚Äôt find a job since most of the businesses had closed down (and everyone and their moms were applying to the ones that WERE open) and therefore couldn‚Äôt find another place to live. I had to move back to FL and have been living back at home (much to both my and my dad‚Äôs dismay) and have been here for about a month. I found a new job so it‚Äôs time to get my own place: either rent a room somewhere or pull the trigger and buy a used fifth-wheel trailer/truck.¬†

\_\_\_\_\_

I‚Äôve had this dream for longer than I can even remember. Here are the goals:

1. have the freedom to visit my family/friends in other states (located in Georgia, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, New York, and California)
2. take my cat with me
3. work remotely‚Ä¶ luckily the job I just got is actually open to this
4. make the RV as self-sufficient as possible
5. travel to the mountains some winters/springs to snowboard/hike

\_\_\_\_\_

Where I would park it:

1. starting in Florida, I may try to talk my dad, aunt, or stepbrother into letting me snag a spot temporarily on a driveway or in a backyard while I get comfortable working any of the kinks/install solar
2. my mom has some room in her backyard in Georgia that she would be open to me visiting for a month or so at a time
3. government land, RV parks, or national parks
4. posting on Craigslist/Facebook and finding people with room in their backyard/driveways (most likely without hookups) who would let me rent weekly or monthly

\_\_\_\_\_

Living in a home on wheels, traveling the US (as much as I can), and working remotely would allow me freedoms on many different levels that I‚Äôm sure most of you can relate to.

I feel that for right now a fifth wheel toy hauler would be perfect for me. My train of thoughts are that:

1. it has efficient space (it has plenty of room for myself, my cat, and for an office in the garage
2. it's pretty stable/safe to pull (with the right vehicle, prepping, and weather conditions)
3. it's meant to be moved around
4. finding spots to park are semi-readily available (though I'd love to have a tiny house someday
5. being able to unhook the truck, would allow me a vehicle to drive around in

\_\_\_\_\_

Here are some things I‚Äôm having trouble with:

1. figuring out how I‚Äôm going to constantly keep my cat cool in the summer and warm in the winter (I know solar would help with this during the summer, but what do people usually do in the wintertime when they‚Äôre traveling through snow and shorter days of sunlight? Just use the generator?)
2. finding a solid option for consistent/reliable wifi for work¬†\*super important\*
3. what type of truck to look at that can actually safely pull it and is not an exorbitant price (I know this depends on the weight of the RV I buy)
4. the toilet situation‚Ä¶ since I‚Äôll be visiting family/friends and areas without hookups, should I think about switching out the toilet for a composting or incinerator toilet? Or keep the original and just go to dump stations?
5. figuring out what length of RVs to look for (I‚Äôve heard anything under 35 feet is welcome in more RV parks)
6. figuring out what year is the oldest RV I should look for (I‚Äôve heard anything over 10 years is sometimes frowned upon in RV parks)

VanLife,"So I'm setting off on my first trip today, and I've never tried to use the Crown Land atlas on my phone until just now. 

Turns out it doesn't work very well (at all). 

I know the general area that I'm setting out for, but I don't know the boundaries and I don't want to assume that private land will be clearly marked.

I‚Äôve already spent a huge portion of my already tight budget on rebuilding the frame and floor/walls/insulation. Now it‚Äôs time for wiring/power set up. 

Does anyone who has a very simple and budget friendly van have any advice or ideas for powering and heating/cooling the space you‚Äôll be living in? I really don‚Äôt want to spend thousands on a solar set up and a huge battery bank like most do in their sprinter vans/skoolies/rv‚Äôs etc.

What are some things you compromised on and still feel decently comfortable living full time on the road? I‚Äôm thinking skip the air conditioner until summer at least, as we‚Äôll be traveling to nice cool places throughout fall and winter. Maybe have a few small fans? I‚Äôve seen people in skoolies do wood burning stoves to warm their space when needed. Anyone have any experience with these type of things?

Hi all - just upgrading from our 1984 t25 home-brew (will be selling very soon) , and have never had any issue with corrosion on the sub-frame, so this is a new one to me...

I am looking at a 2005 1.9tdi T5, partly converted van , going to look at it later today. Looks good in the pics but check on previous MOT shows advisories as 'front sub frame corroded but not seriously weakened - both rear suspension arms corroded but not seriously weakened '

Bearing in mind that it ain't going to get better , is this something that should seriously make me think twice, or is it a weld, or a replacement , and if so, is it a money pit of a job?

Everything else is looking good and the price is ok. What are your thoughts?

Also bearing in mind that they have waxoiled the underneath now, so visually I probably won't be able to see the extent of the corrosion.

I only have a drive of 20 mins to view- should I avoid, or price up the parts and labour for a job on it within the next year or so?

VanLife,"Just tell me van life's worth it. I've lived my life with nothing but lies to myself and to those around me for petty security in the moment, I live with an idiot Father and his stupid girlfriend. This is my story and I just wanna know am I wrong for wanting #vanlife? Just tell me. So my Father is nothing but a fool, he claims I need to live with him forever for security reasons since he's bought into the economy collapsing and thinking some scam cryptocurrencies(not the good ones) are gonna save him. Cuz BUttcoin 1000000000000000000000000000 end of year amirite? Totally not a pie in the sky toddler mindset. He's already told me I should live with him forever and at every turn that I try to suggest some level of minimalism he scolds me. He's already in a lot of debt, paying 500 dollars a month for a truck he barely needs or uses and his girlfriend is racked with a massive amount of financial debt from student loans.  They pay 250 dollars a month for horses that they never really use, making our rent 850 dollars as opposed to 600(which is insanely good for being only an hour from DC). Somehow I need to pay 350 a month in rent which I get 50 is for electric since we never go over 150 a month for electricity. Please just tell me they're stupid and I'm on the right track for wanting a more minimalist, individualistic life that will help me get on my feet and pursue my passion for computers. So we live with our old landlord and she's basically falling apart so she calls us in the middle of the day to just randomly do stuff for her, the other day she wanted me to swim to the bottom of the pool when I was planning on coding instead, which took about two hours since the pool is deep, I had to take pictures and a bunch of other non sense. My Dad and his girlfriend wanna move out and say it's too expensive, I suggested getting rid of the horses they never ride since his girlfriend is going in for multiple spine and other surgeries that could threaten her life if she gets injured riding and she's even filed for disability. Yet everytime I bring up getting rid of the horses they complain about my computer that I've only payed a thousand dollars for as opposed to their horses that cost them nearly 3 thousand dollars a year. Now they wanna move out and instead of downsizing they want and even more expensive mortgage. I got into a heated argument with my Dad and he's trying to lie to me about the horses not costing anything when his girlfriend said it herself that they cost 250 a month extra. Well he wants a mortgage now that will cost nearly 1200 per month (250k) and yet he says he's struggling to pay 850 now which is split between me and him. They even found a place for 85k that would cost about 600 per month with ten acres but that wasn't good enough even though it was perfectly functional and move in ready although it was a little small(only two bedroom and one bath). So these two dunderheads wanna drag me into the pile of garbage they've managed to spew up that is their sorry pathetic life undermined by ""the system"" and give up more money per month. I get the feeling they're using me and just want me to be around since I'm family and will help them. I just wanna leave them desperately. I already have a plan to stealth camp at my job's parking lot since there aren't any patrols really and some people already do it. I can even go in to work at anytime just to use the bathroom(even at night). I'm willing to pull the trigger and sacrifice to reach the stars and every time they derail my genuine needs for financial success when I worked multiple jobs stashing cash like a villain only to pick it up and crumple it up and throw it in my face because of what they call ""life."" I lived away from that nuthouse farm and I never had this many distractions from a landlord who's dying wanting me to be at her beck and call to my Dad's crazy lazy girlfriend who complained about working less than 20 hours per week and watching maury all day and that even though I was juggling 3 jobs, working 60 hours a week I somehow wasn't doing enough. Or when I worked full time and studied full time for computer science, how I just wasn't doing enough as a then 21 year old man. My confidence was destroyed. This pandemic has brought it back, I'm in the best shape I've ever been and even have 4k saved in precious metals that I plan on holding onto. I just wanna get away from here in hopes that I can finally have some independence and decide things for myself. Pursue my passions and hobbies. Am I wrong reddit bros?

I can travel with the seasons and my job would allow me to work in any state anywhere even. So I would be able to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The worst that could go wrong is an accident in my view or some sort of breakdown and I do qualify for an extended warranty on my van.

VanLife,"Hi - we're about to buy our base vehicle for our first conversion and we'd like some advice.

We're pretty set on a Ford Transit Custom with the shorter wheelbase as it will replace our day-to-day car - we use our current car to go to the shops a few times per week but don't use it to commute but we think the shorter wheelbase would make it easier to handle and park. 

We're not giants - I'm the taller of the two and I'm 5'8"" on a good day - but we would like to be able to stand inside the van. Where we're struggling is with deciding whether to go with a fixed high roof or a pop top.

We've been told a low roof is preferable as it will allow us to use shopping centre and beach car parks where there are height barriers. A pop top gives us that flexibility, but also comes at a cost. 

So, a few questions - is an H2L1 Ford Transit Custom going to be cause many problems when it comes to parking? I've also noticed that the H2L1 is relatively rare in comparison to the H1L1, which may impact price and reduce options for purchase.

If we were to get a pop top fitter, would this drastically impact how we fit the rest of the van? Are we forced into carpeted walls, or is that avoidable? Do pop tops introduce other problems?

Many questions - I know - but we'd really appreciate any thoughts or experiences you have with any of the above.",Struggling to decide between a fixed roof and a pop top,1,False,r0bbbo

VanLife,"I built out a van on dec/Jan/Feb I did all the work and design by myself and I am very happy with the outcome. However now that I have lived on it since finishing, I do have a few things I would change.

1. Windows. My van has no windows and I wanted it that way. When first designing my van I was going full stealth mode. I work in the airlines and leave my van in employee parking lots while I am on a trip, some of our bases have a no camper/campervan policy. So I wanted it to look like a work van on the outside. However I do wish I had one of those short style windows hear my bed to allow for better air circulation in the summer. 

2. A fixed bed. I wanted a fixed bed from the start but as I started to design my layout found if I did a Murphy style bed, similar to Jarrod (a YouTuber) I could get far more room. My thinking was that a Murphy bed could still be made up when away, but I forgot about having to clear out the area where it would come down at. If I could change it, I would make it the common sideways style above garage bed. 

3. Bulkhead wall. I built a bulkhead wall between my can and the living spaces again for stealth. While I do really like the privacy of the wall and am about to mount shelves, trash bin, coat hooks and put switched on the wall. I think having no wall and just covering the windows would have been better. Then I could have added another seating area with swivel chairs. 

4. Sliding door use. My layout has the kitchen along the wall across from the sliding door with the couch on the wall of the sliding door, I also built a partition wall so you can't see out from the couch. The wall acts as my vanity mirror with the cassette toilet below. I thought this would give privacy for restroom stuff to the living area but now when I am at a park, I have no way to see out the door when it's open, wish I would have out the couch straight across from the sliding doors. 

5. Couch. I made a L shaped couch with a lagoon table in between. I thought this would be more comfortable and after being in a truck camper for a few months with a booth style seating area, I wanted something unique and different. I now want my booth back. Much better for computer usage and eatting.

Some of these things I can change with a bit of construction and remodeling, others would require a while tear out. I am not sure what to do at this point, but for now I will continue to live with it as is.",What I regret about my van,1,False,Roundtrip_FA

I've inherited a campervan (Fiat Ducato conversion) that has been sitting for around 4 years unused. I'm a newbie to all of this stuff and am not in contact with the auto electrician that did the work.

The 12 volt system seems to be working fine for the lights, and I understand that using the transformer to 240 volts will be very draining on the batteries for most things. The only thing I am really wanting is to be able to charge my phone and other USB devices. We have plugs with USB connections but they're on the 240 volt panels, when the power is turned on for the lights the USB ports do not charge.

VanLife,"I am starting the conversion of a van. I just acquired it a week ago and began cleaning it out yesterday! I was wondering if there were any woodworkers/DIY enthusiasts that could help with some questions I may have along the way?

Background Story: The van is a used DHL van that was later used as a work van for a shop. I got the van from an car mechanic shop so there were bolts, lights, tools, and oil everywhere. It has wiring and I was fortunate enough to acquire one that already has a track on the ceiling (so I don't have to figure out how to drill into the car itself). I'm hoping to do this conversion on a budget and get it done in a timeframe of about a year and a half. New to ALL of this and super excited to get started!

For now, I only have one question:

\- Because it was a working van it has giant wood panel flooring. A significant part of the floor is covered in massive oil stains. I haven't lifted it yet to see what the underside looks like (if that even really matters for this question), but I'm wondering if it's safe to leave as it. My main concerns with the oil covered flooring are ventilation and heat. I'm afraid that with the lack of ventilation (since it only has two operating windows in the front of the van) that the fumes are/will be over-bearing. I'm also afraid of what that means when it heats up - on hot days, or days when we use a heater to warm up the van.

I'm wondering if there are any seals I can apply to close off the engine oil smell? Or if I cover it in paint if that would help as well?

VanLife,"Okay, I know it's not every van, but so many van conversions frame the van, then cover everything with wood planks. This may look cool on Instagram to some, but to me this seems heavy, taking away inches of space, expensive and costing a lot in terms of carbon. Is there any particular reason why it's so popular?

I'm planning to start test driving vans with the intention to convert over the winter, moving to full time living after the new year. 

Here's the idea I'm having but I'm not seeing anyone else do it. so the layers would go, exterior metal, Insulation to come up flush to the metal framing (Roughly a flat surface), frame out the interior similar to how most frame before screwing boards to everything, but then glue layers of stuffing before upholster the walls like it's a chair. Tack the fabric to the framing, to add tension. Perhaps sandwich the fabric with another furring strip if it takes actual staples to hold the fabric in place. I'd still frame out structural members for cabinetry up against the van walls. 

If you keep an eye out at Hobby Lobby it's gotta be cheaper than doing the whole thing in wood. I found a fabric I liked for $15/Yard, and they regularly have crazy sales like half off. Not to mention It's going to cut down on a lot of weight in whatever marginal gains it might have in terms of mileage. 

The only Issues I could see would be vapor barrier where the Fabric is attached. Also perhaps the issue of spilling things on the walls and staining. 

But for visualization, I'd imagine it looks more like the inside of a tee-pee and less like the inside of the Mayflower.

Now I don't expect to be able to join vanlife any time soon.

Realistically, I think it'll be me and Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang and de cat(s) (and possibly raccoon(s)) I've been feeding in the wawa parking lot against the world for now. But I am looking towards the future -- or at least as long as I am teaching in-person doing this pandemic. I'll be doing everything by myself to keep the cost down, for whatever that cost may be (I sure as hell ain't a plumber or electrician or mechanic, but like everything else in life my stubborn ~~and cheap~~ ass down to learn a new skill and possibly heck up in the process before hiring someone else to do something for me), and have a place I'd be able to work on it at and park it and ""refuel"" electricity and water for about $10/day (for the days my stubborn ~~and cheap~~ ass isn't bouncing back and forth between Wawa-McDonalds-Walmart parking lots).

I'm looking to get my first car for myself in a year for my 30th birthday. I'm based in a large North American city and my budget is around 10k (15k max budget; 5k for first few months insurance/any work or repairs. Ideally looking for more of an 8/7 split). 

I'm extremely interested in the van life but I've never done it before - I've only done a few road trips in cars. My goal is to work on my bucket list of driving every single National Scenic Byway in the States in my 30s. I plan on doing week or month long trips between jobs.

VanLife,"Hi all, I know this isn't exactly a Van, but it's a fairly short (21') RV, so I hope you'll consider me an honorary member. I just bought a 1994 21' Gulfstream Conquest that I'm super excited to turn into my new home. I would like to install as much solar as possible on it. I'm currently looking at the Renogy 300w 12v Solar RV Kit. I've heard good things about Renogy on here before, but any advice pro/con on this system or any alternate brand recommendations are greatly appreciated.

So, my questions:
1) On my 21' roof will the 3 panels (42.2"" x 19.6"") be about all that I can fit up there, considering the air con unit is kind of right in the middle of everything. Can you mount one of the panels over/above the air con unit, or is that asking for trouble? I see Renogy also has a 100w 12v ""add on"" supplemental package which I assume is just another panel and wiring/connectors. Would that be a good idea? Or if there's room, could I even buy 2 of the 300w, 3 panel systems and tie them together?
2) What batteries would everyone recommend? I see Renogy has a Deep Cycle AGM Battery 12 v 200ah for $399 on their website. Would that be enough if I was in a fairly sunlit place to keep fridge, radio, air con going? Is that the battery most people use? Any other battery recommendations?
3) Can I buy 2 or 3 more of these batteries and link them up? Is there a limit to how much the panels will charge? Hypothetically could I link 100 of these batteries together and get 2000ah of juice stored up? Is that how this works? Is that how any of this works? 
3) Does anyone have any good recommendations on videos showing how to install a remote controlled tilting system to point the panels at the direction of the sun. Or even a system that automatically tracks the sun somehow? Does this exist?
4) Like I said, I'm a complete newbie to all things solar but I'm fairly handy and I have every tool imaginable. So I think with the right advice/videos to watch I could install just about anything.
5) Also, my RV didn't come with a generator. Any recommendations on something quiet, powerful and portable? Any generators to avoid?  I plan on having as much solar as possible so I'm hoping I don't have to use the generator too much, but I know I'll need one.
5) So any advice on equipment, design, batteries, generators etc would be greatly appreciated. Even just pointing me to some of the better YT videos on these topics would great. Any links would be very welcome. I'd ideally like to make my own video to post to show my own mistakes, challenges and hopefully final, working installation that others can learn from as well.

VanLife,"Hello,

Since a few weeks I‚Äôve been exploring on Reddit and a few of its subreddits, especially the Reddits about vanlife and the outdoors. I‚Äôm not really the big talker so the fact that I feel like sharing a bit of my story is quite interesting to me. The core of this post will be about the insights I‚Äôve had while traveling and what the vanlife has brought me so far. I feel like there is a lot of doubt when it comes to committing to the vanlife for a longer period of time. Maybe this can be a bit of a help for those who are considering a personal vanlife expedition. I think a little backstory would be best, however if you want to just have a quick sense about it, feel free to skip to the end or just watch the images and videos. Being born and rooted in Flanders, my native language is Dutch. So, pardon me for my English, I‚Äôll do my best.

**Background**

My name is Floris, 27 years old and I‚Äôm living in my van since January 2020, together with my dog Sauron. I graduated as a social worker and worked for 4,5 years in a youth community development project. In short I was responsible for developing a healthy community/culture in a rather tough neighborhood. Building trust, bringing the youth together and support them in taking the ‚Äòdriving wheel‚Äô of their own neighborhood and free time in a good way were the key aspects of my job. Aside from that I was a reference point for all the youth and their network. Any question would be good and most of their questions circled around education, work, drugs or were neighborhood related. 

In my free time I was and still am very passionate about Wing Chun, Taiji, MMA, hiking, being in the outdoors and spending time with my friends. I‚Äôve always been pretty busy in sports but for the last 8 years it has been purely martial arts, mainly Wing Chun. Aside from that I really love special beers and weed. In fact I‚Äôve been smoking weed daily for the past 10 years and during the 4,5 years I was working I also drank some beers every evening. I didn‚Äôt drink until I was drunk but still every evening like 6 - 7 beers. Those years were great but there was also an inner voice calling ‚Äú Is this routine how you are going to spend all of your time from now on?‚Äù.

When I was around one year into my employment the urge began to grow to experience a completely empty schedule. Or rather no schedule at all, just go with the flow. To be totally free for the first time. No school stuff that you have to do to get your degree, no meetings for work that you have to be at to earn money to pay the bills and my lifestyle, nothing**... How would I spend my time when I was totally free and on my own?** That urge grew and grew and one year later when I had a vacation and went hiking in France it became clear to me that I just had to go for it, I would not forgive myself otherwise. I did some thinking and gave myself 2 years to finish my projects at work and save enough money to buy a van and gather some travel money. In those 2 years my plan would keep on getting more and more refined.

**The travelplan/Ikigai**

As I said I‚Äôve been practicing Kung Fu for almost 10 years. Not in a constant manner, more in like a wave frequency. There were months where I trained weekly, other months daily, a month almost nothing and so on. However the passion never fades and YouTube knew that very well. It kept feeding me lots of Kung Fu from masters around the world. Some things I saw I just couldn‚Äôt believe, especially when it comes to the more internal skills like certain Taiji Masters showcase. I started to put dots on the map: who are those masters and where can I find them? And so a first kind of route developed. That combined with my passion for mountains and beautiful nature in general made the route develop further and further. 

The route is one thing but I was also thinking a lot about my path in general. This journey would not just be a vacation. It would be a trip of inner discovery and cultivation. Pushing the hard reset button. I wanted to explore myself and my boundaries. Questions like: How good do I know myself? Wat is my hidden potential? When will I be sad? Can I truly be happy? How big is my ego? When will I miss my family and friends? When will I miss the alcohol and the weed? When will I miss all the comforts of home? Will I like it to be alone all the time? How long can I go out into the mountains with one backpack?...

Years ago a friend introduced me to the term Ikigai. To explain in my words the Ikigai is the point where 3 things come together: What do you love to do? What does the world need? What can you get paid for? This concept stuck with me for a lot of reasons and I think it is a big underlying factor in my motivation to do all this. Being free to do what you love.

Skillwise the main goal is the further development of my martial art- and survival skills. That combined with the development of the more introspective qualities, true inner peace and harmony, the ultimate goal being freedom in body and mind. Almost every story I heard or read about the great Taiji or Zen masters had something in common: they all meditated and they all talk about the essentiality of the quiet and empty mind. To be honest I have found myself to have lot of tensions in my body and mind. 5 years ago I thought I was a pretty chill guy, down to earth, not too big of an ego,‚Ä¶ The more attention I gave to the matter, the more I found out that I had the wrong idea about myself. Already a lot has changed but still I‚Äôm only scratching the surface of the real internal work.

After watching a lot of YouTube bushcrafters, hikers and survivalists in my free time I decided I would also take a camera with me and try to make some videos about my journey. It seemed like it would be cool for my friends and family, for myself and maybe even some people outside of my network. In essence I see the moviemaking as building my curriculum vitae and I‚Äôll continue to do it as long as I enjoy doing it. 

Begin February 2020 I left home together with my dog Sauron. It was super exiting to finally start the journey I had been planning for over 2 years. One side note was very important to me: plans can change. I would not force myself to do any of the things I had in mind before I left. If the training, the hiking, the meditation, the seeking out of the masters,.. didn‚Äôt come spontaneously, I wouldn‚Äôt do it. If I felt after a few months that I had misjudged all this, I would not let my pride be a factor and just go back home.

**The Stealth Van**

I won‚Äôt go too deep into this but everyone that has converted a van will probably know that is a challenging project in its own regard. The research part is a very time-consuming aspect of the vanbuild. In the beginning I thought I would keep it to a bare minimum, I just wanted a place to fall back to when things got hard. As I started researching my wishes started to change and my initial plan to keep the vanbuild to a bare minimum was thrown out of the window rather quickly.

And so I bought a van (Volkswagen crafter L1H1 from 2013), had a design in my head and bought everything that I needed. After all the hours of preparation I finally could start the building part. After a few months, building only in the weekends, my van was finished. I learned so much during the process and awkward enough during the build I was already making plans for the second vanbuild, whenever that will be.. 

Very important to me was that my van would be as secure and stealthy as possible. My plan was to go on longer trips with my backpack so my van would often be unguarded for longer periods of time, often with a lot valuable stuff in it. This is the reason I haven‚Äôt put in any extra windows. I also put a security film on my windows so a quick break-in would be impossible. All my doors are also heavily secured. No way to enter my van quickly if I lock it properly.

**Insights**

\- The first month I really had to acclimate. I hiked a lot with my dog but I didn‚Äôt train so much. I did start my daily meditation training in the first week after departure. I slept terrible for a month due to the detox. The nightmares in combination with the meditation made the first month emotional pretty heavy. Nevertheless it was a damn good exercise to feel all the shit from the past boiling up and letting it go. 

\- After a few days the thoughts about alcohol and weed were already much less. I was very amazed with that considering I was an addict for 10 years. The detox, the nightmares and sweating at night were a really intense wake up when it comes to acknowledging what kind of shit I had put into my system all those years. You don‚Äôt know it until you quit. After 2 weeks the thoughts about smoking and drinking were almost gone. When drinking a coffee it stung to not have a cigarette and even now, when I drink a beer, I instantaneously think about something to smoke. I wonder when that will fade.

\- I am much more synchronized with nature when it comes to my sleeping pattern. I also need less sleep.

\- In week 3 I did my first 2 hour training session, totally unscheduled. On that day I really got into the vibe I wanted to be in. In the next few days I started to train just after a short walk with Sauron and breakfast. It evolved into doing my 2 hour (do what I have to do) session before midday so that anything that I would train in the afternoon and evening was like a bonus. It feels very good to be finished with all your most crucial to do‚Äôs early in the day. 

\- I started playing the digeridoo and took up my pois again.

\- Almost instantly I became vegetarian. Mostly because I was living on a tight budget and see meat as a luxe product. Since then becoming full time veggie is in my mind almost every time I eat meat.

\- I started eating more healthy than ever before. I started having breakfast again, eating very healthy and zero junk food. I also gained a few kilo‚Äôs in weight, which I was happy with since I found myself a bit too skinny.

\- I found out rather quickly that I didn‚Äôt need any of the things that made seemingly happy in my daily routine at home. Every craving is also a form of suffering..

\- I often think about the Less is More phrase. It resonates deeply.

\- I enjoy the little things a lot more. Activities like cooking, walking the dog, drinking a cup of tea,‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs also like everything I eat tastes better.

\- After a good month the seated practice (I can‚Äôt really call it meditation yet) started to feel deeper and I noticed that every single time after I meditate I do something useful. Mostly I just rolled into another part of training.

\- The videomaking and especially the making of time lapses keeps bringing me to very nice places and views.

\- I started a daily vlog in English with a double functionality. To keep talking and reflecting out loud and also to practice my English. It feels right to reflect on a daily basis and capture some of it, the medium doesn‚Äôt matter. I just prefer speaking to practice my English.

\- Travelling with a dog is great but as everything it has its pros and cons. I can‚Äôt imagine doing this without Sauron anymore though.

\- In total I train between 2 and 6 hours almost every day and my training has become much more constant instead of a ‚Äòwave frequency‚Äô. Aside from that my days are filled with hiking, cooking and moviemaking and an occasional siesta. 

\- **The hard reset button and the change of context is working greatly. I am more disciplined and more fulfilled than ever. Having a plan whilst adhering to the principle of not forcing anything and just going with the flow feels right.**

This will be all for this post, I never imagined it would get so long. For all those who read the whole thing, thank you for bearing with me. I would be happy to hear any of the insights of other travelers/starting meditators or anyone else that can relate to this. Below you can find some of images and videos of my journey. Also, if you want to see some of the travel stories of me and Sauron or you just like some experimental YouTube content with no talking (yet), here is the link to my channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQtW7DBVdjGCYl-xNVvLQlg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQtW7DBVdjGCYl-xNVvLQlg)

Thank you very much, until the next one!

In peace

VanLife,"I just quit my corporate job after 10 years. I‚Äôm selling my million dollar condo. I‚Äôm selling all my shit. I have cash. I want to buy the best pre built van (24 feet or shorter) (from airstream/Winnebago/whoever) that exists and I want to get the fuck out of here. I‚Äôm not trying to fiddle fart around to save a penny here or there. I busted my ass for long enough that I don‚Äôt have to worry about it, happy to send a picture of my fucked hairline for you to agree.

I want the Van to work great, I want it to look nice. I‚Äôm handy enough, I don‚Äôt mind a bit of slogging if I need to fix something or put some money into it. but there are a few things I want that some have and some don‚Äôt.

1. AC/Heat and I want it to run for 8 hours during the night. I don‚Äôt want to turn on a loud ass generator to do this. I want to be able to be in hot climates and not care. It looks like I will have to spend about 20k and get an aftermarket system using lithium or Tesla batteries/inverter and solar. I‚Äôll be getting in touch with the boondoctor about this one but open to suggestions. 
2. Shower and toilet. A dry bath would be amazing (only one I‚Äôve seen is the 2015 Winnebago era 70c, which looks really cool). I really want this shit (pun intended) to be as hassle free as humanly possible. Easy empty, easy fill, no smells, clean. I want to be able to watch a movie in the middle of the night and not have to diarrhea in the woods because I have IBS from years of insane levels of stress. 
3. Small kitchen, I just need to be able to cook for one. Nothing crazy needed here. 
4. Some storage would be nice so I can put my bike inside at night. 
5. Stealth. I will be doing a lot of urban boondocking. Whatever van I get its fine if it has stupid colors or markings or whatever I will have it painted a flat color like black or white and all decals removed. (The stealth thing is another reason for the not using a generator)

And that‚Äôs really it. 4x4 would be nice but whatever, I would like to be able to attach a motorcycle to the van somehow, but I don‚Äôt really care that much.

Later, when my dad passed, my mom would pack 3 kids and a dog into a VW bug and drive us around the SouthWest. As an adult I traveled the country in my car, and when I could, my mom on driving trips. Then I landed in Santa Barbara, the Riveria of the West Coast. I am happy here! The weather is perfect. I have many friends. My career was a good one. I am home rich and cash poor. Very, very limited funds. BUT my dream has always been that when I retire, I will see some of the rest of the country I have not. Southern dreams, Northern lights, plains where bison roam, historic sights of Philadelphia, Boston, and D.C., the Puget Sound and the Florida Keys. I know that my husband's dream - and he sacrificed much - was to retire in our mobile home near the beach, sit on the porch, walk on the sand, and stay grounded; no  one to answer to, in the home he fought so hard to keep. How do we reconcile this need for me to go, and him to stay? We don't have a van and can't afford to buy or rent one, so it would be in our Volvo 240 wagon which he has said he just can't camp in. Growing up and in adulthood, he never camped or took a lot of trips. He doesn't like it. What do I do? I have considered going alone, but I would miss him too much. He loves me and wants me to be happy, but because of the sacrifices he made (a lot) to just own even a mobile home, he can't loosen his grip on his security. I may have thought of it before - I have been mulling it for years - but ALL helpful suggestions (beyond leaving my husband) are welcome. Maybe there's something I haven't considered.

VanLife,"Newb here. I‚Äôm just starting to get an understanding of solar power, but some things are really stumping me. 

I‚Äôve got a general understanding of how solar panels would work if I installed them in my truck camper that I‚Äôm currently remodeling. Sun goes into panels, energy goes down into charge controller, the charge controller then regulates that energy, and it moves on to the battery and is stored there. Then the battery is connected to wires within the walls of my camper that are used to power all of the DC stuff, such as the lights, water pump, etc etc. 

But this is where things get a little murky for me. 

I understand that in order to use an AC powered appliance, I need to get an inverter. So I‚Äôll get that, and it will be used to charge my AC devices. But what if I have something that is DC powered, such as the coveted (and expensive as fuck) Dometic fridge that I‚Äôve been pondering? Where do I plug or connect that in? Are there wires to connect it directly to the battery? How does that work?

VanLife,"Hi guys, 

I posted my van build after it was built (  [https://imgur.com/a/pgyat5R](https://imgur.com/a/pgyat5R) ) but since made some changes based on experiences in the van.  [https://imgur.com/a/yWsGyOf](https://imgur.com/a/yWsGyOf) 

I've been around Europe in it so far but back in the UK now due to covid. Some notable changes are a smaller gas canister,  removal of the project, and purchase on an awning. The pictures also show a box of electricals including an electric oven. I haven't grabbed any pictures but when I'm not staying at a campsite, I take out the box and put a battery-powered shower, a chemical toilet, and a pop-up tent in this space. I usually stay at a campsite if they are more than two people camping. 

A lot of builds that I've seen here in the UK are VW Transporters, which look like a great van. However, I hope this build may persuade people who may opt for a cheaper van to get started into vanlife! I've had the trafic two years now and it's a great little camper.",Renault Trafic Van Update,1,False,ttom1234
VanLife,"I added my van build when it was first done but it needed some finishing touches. I thought I'd post the current build if anyone is interested.

 [https://imgur.com/a/pgyat5R](https://imgur.com/a/pgyat5R) \- These are the old images.

Another change was the projector screen that I had, although it was good for nighttime viewing it was very fiddling to setup. I saw online the back of the seat mounts for van TV's, although being a techy the quality always seems quite low on these TV's. I've now added a computer monitor which usually lasts at least 8hrs on the leisure battery and runs an amazon firestick. I've also got unlimited data internet in the van with 3 which seems to get a good signal.   


Also, the electric oven and other electrics at the back of the van are in a box. If I decide to wild camp I swap out these electricals and put in a battery-powered shower, chemical toilet, and a popup tent which all fits nicely.

VanLife,"Hello all.

Fast breakdown we've known this indian family for as long as we've lived here, and now the dad is dying.  Since we're basically family, he gave me a deal of 800 bucks for his prized possession van, which I am stoked to own, but the responsibility is a bit for me.  I feel like I should do right by it though and update it a little bit.  However, I respect this guy a lot, and while it may be my van now, in my mind, its still his van.  I don't feel like fucking it up immensely.

So its about a 1998ish GMC 1500 Aero that was made at Hartland Conversions in Flint MI.  Its interior needs a complete detailing, the cabin lights are dim / not working, I need to redo one break in one corner and refresh the freon, so I've already got sort of a short list.  However, I want to ask yall if you know of any electronic gremlins I may run into?

My shortlist of current issues is pretty much:

What should I replace the light panels with?  What voltages are those panels, if anyone knows?

How easy is it to fix a power lift (Ie power couch in the back of the van gets stuck

Is it possible to put one of the spare seats on a swivel?

What do I do about the shrinking rubber seals around the windows?

Will the roof leak being cut off and replaced?

With a van like this having all the cabin shit in there, whats the standard weight limit?

&amp;#x200B;

Everything else, I think, should be pretty straight forward, right?  Its basically just a GMC truck, standard 350, just with a different box on the back.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically am I just going to have problems having a cabin?  Could I call hartland and get an info dump on my model?  How can I look up my exact package?

Are there wiring diagrams?

And, with as much effort has been poured into this thing to keep it about 89% as close to how it was on lot as possible, since I plan to daily this thing, how long till something bad actually happens?

&amp;#x200B;

VanLife,"Hello Everyone,

I was recently rear-ended, and the other driver's insurance company is using regular cargo vans as comparables.

**I'm wondering if there's any benefit to insisting that they use converted camper vans as comparables?** (Other than the satisfaction of me being a butt-head) They say there's no difference since the VIN is the same, but California law does allow it to be registered with a different body type (VC, or van camper) and the law does say it has to be similar, including....*of a similar body type...*  (10 CCR ¬ß 2695.8 (b)(2)).

It doesn't look like the value would be that much more, but since they're (so far) calling it a total loss, I think any increase in value would help prevent a total. 

They're also telling me I can't use Craigslist for comparables. I can't find any campers for sale outside of CL though..and I'd argue CA law allows this to be classified as a Motorhome and/or Van Camper, and it's definitely approved ""for human habitation"". The DMV inspected it &amp; accepted form REG 256A.  Cargo vans are none of these.

**Does anyone know where I could find actual comparables to put the ""fair"" in Fair Market Value?** It's a 2000 GMC Safari.

There are a few methods that you can use to minimize data usage without affecting your experience while browsing or streaming.

1) Use an adblocker to stop ads from loading on websites, this cuts down on data usage significantly especially on websites like Youtube where an ad can be a long video. [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/cpp495) is a browser that is similar to Google Chrome but it has an ad-blocker built in, it works on PC and mobile.

2) Try to download movies and TV shows anytime you have access to wifi, Netflix has an option to download some shows for offline viewing if you go into the description page of a show. The website [SaveMomo](https://savemomo.com) will allow you to do the same thing on Youtube by downloading the videos.

3) Go into the settings on Snapchat/Whatsapp and turn off automatic image downloading when you're not on Wifi, this means you will have to click an image before it starts downloading. Take advantage of places that offer free wifi to download all your images/videos at once.

After purchasing a van at the beginning of 2020 because I‚Äôve always wanted one, I‚Äôm considering living a minimalist lifestyle in it. I am running into a few concerns that seem to make this infeasible. Looking to the community for how others surpassed these obstacles:

1. Non-traveling van life? - I will not be traveling so much as I have a demanding job that requires me to stay local. In this case where would I park nightly? Campground? Family members house? 
I would be hoping to do a mix but is wondering if others have something like a home base.

2. My cat? - While I am at work during the day how can I make the van suitable for a cat? I‚Äôm assuming A/C is the answer, so then my question is what solar/battery/generator combo do I need to run this at least 8hrs/day while I‚Äôm at work. (Presently she does spend all day in my bedroom until I get home and we spend evenings outside, so I think she‚Äôll be pretty well suited for van life) Alternatively I could drop her off at daycare with mom/grandma daily...

3. Fridge/Freezer? - Can‚Äôt determine if I need one. But I feel buying food fresh every day would get old... then I may get fast food for convenience :( Any suggestions welcome on small, efficient units

4. Closet and hygiene? - I would like to see people‚Äôs closets! I‚Äôve seen a few but am looking for some more ideas. Right now I‚Äôm thinking slim, slide out drawers (38‚ÄùW x 18‚ÄùD x 8‚ÄùH) as I have a larger version of that I‚Äôm my closet now. 
For hygiene I‚Äôm wondering if I should get a shower tent and those camping showers or just go to a friend/family member‚Äôs house everyday... keeps me social but I think it would get old. (This brings me back to where I should park that it wouldn‚Äôt be weird to whip out the shower tent)
Van is too small to build in a bathroom but I will have a sink and a portable toilet that doubles as a stool/footrest.

5 - Insulation? - Is it really necessary? I live in San Diego where the weather is perfect, I always sleep with my windows open now! I have huge netting so I can keep the doors/windows/hatch open, and can bundle when it‚Äôs cold. Or am I being optimistic?

Making some sketches for some different mini-builds, as this is a very small van! But right now I live in a little studio and don‚Äôt use most of the space/stuff in there! I‚Äôm ready to purge, store what‚Äôs important, and live small!

VanLife,"Hey all,

So I'm looking for a winter job to ride out the winter until covid dies down in the spring (hopefully).  If also like to get a bunch of snowboarding in this winter.  For reference I'm located on the south coast of British Columbia Canada.

I'm looking at lots of employment postings coming up in Whistler and while there's certainly lots of open positions, there's obviously no affordable housing - except for the odd cleaning or housekeeping job that offers discounts on staff housing.  I've done those before, it's usually a dorm situation.  Not bad I guess.

However, I would like to camp full time in my vehicle to save some money on the housing costs.  Even $300/ month is still $2,400 after 8 months.  However, the biggest obstacle for me at least is the actual town.

Whistler is notoriously awful towards vanlifers.   I've heard they actually patrol parking lot #1-4 at night with flashlights and will will try to look inside vehicles to check for sleepers.  They target anything even remotely looking like a van, including my minivan.  This for me is the biggest reason why I wouldn't want to accept a job.  Worse case scenario, I'll just take a housekeeper position with the reduced rate for accommodation.

Another option for me is to just look at other resorts.  The powder highway is really awesome and Fernie is an excellent little ski town.

Specifically, the distance between the two rails under the seat is a whopping 14"", while most swivels I've seen are at about 11. I've seen a couple ones labeled ""universal"" but I'm really hesitant to order something $300+ with no real idea of it will even work. 

Has anyone worked with a conversion van style seat like these? Any pointers or recommendations? Is it a situation where I'll just need to buy a WHOLE SEAT? Thanks in advance!

I‚Äôm new to reddit so I hope I‚Äôm doing this right and y‚Äôall can help out. I‚Äôm a 24 year old production assistant in the film/television industry and have lived in my Subaru Impreza for 3 years (I had a lot of CC debt, but kept living simple after paying it off).

My car is paid for and now worth $13k &amp; I have about 10k savings I‚Äôm willing to throw into a van conversion.

I found a local dealer with a short wheel base Transit 350 pass van (wrap around windows) in my price range at $15.5k. 

A comparable cargo van (a 150) is starting at $17k.

Which would you choose? I hear bad things about too many windows. I originally wanted no windows, but a 350 at this price may be worth it. This is my first van and a big financial investment so I‚Äôd appreciate any advice for a young solo guy trying to keep living free, but a little more comfortably.

Once I have the van, have worked on myself and feel like I have grown I really would like to use the van to go on therapy trips into nature with children struggling with mental illness or low selfesteem to reconnect with their emotions, acctualy everyone that might have a benefit from it.

I don't want to wait another 5 years because I fear that I will have other things on my minds then so I made this crowdfunding page.

Before that (when selling for $1,200) he put in new tires, shocks, carburetor, radiator, alternator, Ôøºmaster cylinder, and plugs. Seems like he's only used it for gigging with a band. Doesn't look like there's any rust. Just want to know if this looks good to anyone else. Would $2,000 be a reasonable price to bargain with? Here's some photos.

I can build your van from scratch or help with any aspect of your build.  Electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, interior build, etc

You supply the materials as well as any components needed - I‚Äôll supply my tools, time, experience and work space. 

I‚Äôve been focusing the last few years on doing low cost, useful builds that look good.  My goal is to produce vans that don‚Äôt cost a fortune but are extremely useful and manage space effectively.  While still looking good in the process.

My workshop is centrally located near Binghamton, NY.  It‚Äôs only a few hours from Philadelphia, Washington DC, New York City.  You can bring your van and sleep in it/camp nearby while we do the work or grab a motel nearby as well.","Let me build your van or help with aspects of it - Northeast, USA",1,False,HomefreeNotHomeless

VanLife,My journey to finding a van continues!! I am pretty sure I want a 2000s Ford Econoline with a high roof because I am not mechanically savvy and want a car that has easy accessible parts for cheap. Ya girl would love a sprinter but is on a budget lol Are there better vans that I am missing or other opinions of vans that are cheaper that would have the same qualities? Or are there any Ford Econoline lovers that are having the best time with their van?? Thanks so much!,Ford Econoline orrrr...,1,False,DeVine_Nonchalance

VanLife,"Currently considering purchasing a van, but having a few doubts here and there, was considering keeping my car while owning my van and parking it at my parents, so that I can keep it there to work on, and only use it for weekends or trips away for long periods.

But now I'm wondering if it would just be better to sell my car and use the van as a daily driver as well as have it as a camper. I don't drive my car that much, only around town here and there and the occasional 100 mile trip to visit family.

I'm not extremely well off, so the thought of saving money by only owning 1 vehicle seems a lot better, but I feel the van will be difficult to use before its converted into a camper, and I'm worried about getting too many miles/average wear and tear driving it at as a daily. Just wanted to hear some thoughts/opinions and experiences.

Should I sell my car and use the van full time AND for camping away?

Or should I keep my car and only use the van when convenient?","Considering the van life, should I sell my car and use my van as a daily driver?",1,False,Kyleduder
